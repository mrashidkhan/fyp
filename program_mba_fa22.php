                                            Atco Laboratories is the most admired and renewed pharmaceutical sector of
                                            Pakistan, providing
                                            the quality of products while complying the top highest level of
                                            professional standards and
                                            responsibility. In Atco, there is a SOP that at least keep 3 approved
                                            vendors in the vendors list
                                            therefore, the development department keep on working to develop the new
                                            approved vendors
                                            and alternate vendors so that they can arrange the quality of raw material
                                            from their supplier
                                            without any hurdle, there are few vendors those have no competitors either
                                            locally or
                                            international so in that case company are bound to buy and bear the monopoly
                                            suppliers. In this
                                            research, structured interviews from the supply chain officials of Atco
                                            Laboratories are conducted
                                            to understand the effects of their company’s supply chain operations. We
                                            will also conduct a
                                            questionnaire survey from various other companies supply chain officials to
                                            collect the relevant
                                            data needed for this research. When import is low then production is not
                                            unstoppable and could
                                            not feed the demand of a customer and shortfall of medicines which let the
                                            sales volume to be
                                            50%. After discussing with Pakistan medical association, they discuss with
                                            government.
                                            Government brings the relaxation in supply chain of pharmaceutical
                                            industries so that they cover
                                            the need and demand of medicines but failed to do so due to the reason that
                                            raw materials are
                                            brought from India. Now situation is that raw materials are not available
                                            and easily import from
                                            India if we bring them as per production schedule, raw material is for only
                                            10 days production so
                                            to overcome this situation pharmaceutical companies goes for over stocking
                                            to meet the needs
                                            and demands of a customer and do not let the medicines unavailable in the
                                            market, raw materials
                                            also come in passenger flights although it is costly but pharmaceutical
                                            companies took this step
                                            due to the reason that50% of material is required from import section to
                                            develop a product.

                                            The study focused on the problems faced by Food Panda in their e-commerce

                                            Deeping down into the problem we identified the core areas where the shoe

                                            In the current era of expanding globalization and changing working trends
                                            and practices, firms
                                            confront several common difficulties, one of which is high turnover and low
                                            staff retention.
                                            Studies have indicated that it is a permanent phenomenon for organizations.
                                            This case paints a
                                            comprehensive picture of the ongoing staff retention problem, which affects
                                            all businesses and
                                            is particularly prevalent in the BPO industry. Because of the changing
                                            working environment, it is
                                            critical to address the issue of staff retention, or the company may suffer
                                            significant losses in the
                                            long term. In the case of Hub Digit LLC, the company is having difficulty
                                            retaining employees
                                            because of the reputation their industry has since people believe there is
                                            no job security or
                                            stability. So, a person joins the firm, spends some time there, gains
                                            insights and experience, and
                                            as soon as they find a better chance, they switch to it, disregarding all
                                            the benefits and privileges
                                            that come with the position they hold. We will analyze and determine the
                                            causes of low retention
                                            in this case study. This case study will also assist us in analyzing the
                                            efforts that businesses should
                                            make to cope with market trends and employee needs, such as remuneration,
                                            job rotation,
                                            performance management, time, and attendance tracking, and so on.

                                            This research is intended to provide solutions to the distribution and
                                            logistical problems of
                                            chocolate in rural areas of Sindh. The Ismail industry is located in the
                                            Baluchistan industrial
                                            trading estate in Pakistan. The following are the three major distribution
                                            and logistical issues:
                                            Heavy rain or other weather conditions can cause roadblocks, wasting time
                                            and preventing the
                                            product from reaching the customer. Second, lock in fuel prices. Since the
                                            uncertainty in fuel
                                            rates is a major problem nowadays, Ismail Industries must lock in their
                                            rates by setting monthly
                                            projections with PSO. It will lead them towards the best utilization of a
                                            given budget and avoid
                                            major fluctuation. The third one is maintenance of vehicles. I observed that
                                            some transactions
                                            were mismanaged by the vendors due to vehicles breaking down during
                                            transactions, which
                                            caused failure in achieving targeted trips. Ismail Industries must restrict
                                            vendors from carrying
                                            out routine maintenance on their vehicles, and records must be maintained
                                            and evaluated to
                                            secure maximum incidents and timely deliveries. All the data was gathered
                                            from rural retailers
                                            and wholesalers via phone calls and live question and answer sessions so
                                            that the company could
                                            provide distribution of now chocolates in rural Sindh, increasing market
                                            share and demand.

                                            In the recent era of increasing globalization and changing working trends
                                            and practices
                                            organizations face several common problems and among many problems that
                                            organizations face
                                            a major one is of high turnover and low retention of employees; studies have
                                            found that it is
                                            rather permanent phenomenon for the organizations. This case draws a
                                            holistic picture of the
                                            ongoing retention problem of the newer or younger generation, as we all know
                                            that the new
                                            generation has a short span of attention, and their retention is a problem
                                            today for almost all
                                            types of organizations. The changing working environment has made it
                                            extremely necessary to
                                            deal with the matter of employee retention because the company can face
                                            severe losses in the
                                            long run. In the case of Quick Food Industries (Pvt) Ltd – MonSalwa; the
                                            company is having a
                                            problem in retaining people from the newer or younger generation because the
                                            retention rates
                                            are low if we look at the turnover ratio of new hires and factory workers,
                                            while on the other hand
                                            the the company has been successful in retaining older/ senior employees. In
                                            this case study we
                                            will be analyzing and determining the causes of low retention of a newer
                                            generation of
                                            employees. Furthermore, this study will shed light on the perspective of
                                            employers related to the
                                            turnover and retention of employees. This case study will also help us

                                            Data analytics has revolutionized decision making and organizational
                                            effectiveness in various
                                            industries, including the banking sector. In the National Bank of Pakistan
                                            (NBP), data analytics
                                            plays a crucial role in improving business processes, enhancing customer
                                            experience, and
                                            optimizing resource utilization. One of the key benefits of data analytics
                                            in NBP is its ability to
                                            provide real-time insights into various business operations. For example,
                                            data analytics can help
                                            NBP identify trends and patterns in customer behavior, enabling the bank to
                                            offer targeted
                                            marketing campaigns and personalized services. Similarly, data analytics can
                                            help the bank
                                            optimize its lending and risk management processes, Furthermore, data
                                            analytics can help NBP
                                            optimize its resource utilization and reduce costs. By analyzing data on
                                            employee productivity,
                                            the bank can identify areas where resources can be allocated more
                                            effectively and implement
                                            strategies to improve efficiency. This can help NBP reduce operational
                                            costs, while improving the
                                            overall effectiveness of the organization. <br>
                                            Overall, the use of data analytics in NBP has helped the bank make more
                                            informed and accurate
                                            decisions, leading to improved organizational effectiveness and better
                                            outcomes for customers.

                                                existing facility of S.I.T.E in
                                                Karachi where fruits, vegetables, pharmaceuticals’, frozen foods are
                                                manufactured, imported and
                                                commercially traded. According to the estimates of this feasibility, the
                                                proposed cold store will have
                                                an additional capacity to store 18036 (or 750 Tons) square feet of any
                                                given time. The storage
                                                capacity utilization for different fruits and vegetables and frozen
                                                foods items will be determined on
                                                seasonal basis. As the proposed facility is compartmentalized,
                                                therefore, multiple fruits, vegetables
                                                and commodities will be stored at the same time. The starting storage
                                                capacity utilization of the full
                                                space is assumed at 80% (i.e. 50428 square feet) whereas maximum
                                                capacity utilization is
                                                considered as 100% (63035 square feet). This capacity utilization is
                                                estimated to be economically
                                                viable and justifies the capital as well as operational costs of the
                                                project. However, complete
                                                adherence to best agronomic practices is critical to the success of this
                                                project. Therefore, technical
