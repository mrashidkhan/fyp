                                        <p class="card-text text-justify">In Pakistan large number of people especially
                                            children are suffering from Iron deficiency/anemia. It is observed that the
                                            hemoglobin level especially in females is dangerously below the range.
                                            Therefore,
                                            they are bound to use supplements which can cause side effects,
                                            most importantly constipation. To overcome this problem and to eradicate the
                                            use of supplements,
                                            we have tried to highlight the importance of an iron rich fruit i.e.,
                                            Dates. Dates are very beneficial for our health according to the scientific
                                            as well as religious perspective. Dates are high in several nutrients,
                                            fibers and antioxidants that provide health benefits ranging from improved
                                            digestion to a reduced risk of diseases. As we know dates are enriched with
                                            iron,
                                            our main objective is to study the impact of dates on hemoglobin,
                                            partial pressure of oxygen,
                                            and pulse rate. For this purpose,
                                            we have chosen individuals from different lifestyles,
                                            genders,
                                            age groups and blood groups. By recording the readings through different
                                            devices such as;
                                            oximeter,
                                            hemoglobin kit,
                                            and sphygmomanometer,
                                            we have basically observed the effects of dates on different individuals
                                            regarding their hemoglobin level,
                                            pulse rate and partial pressure by giving them an iron rich diet. After
                                            calculating the mean and standard deviation of hemoglobin level,
                                            pulse rate and partial pressure of oxygen for male and female we concluded
                                            that the average increment in Hb level is observed to be from 0.7 to 1%,
                                            whereas there was no increment in partial pressure of oxygen and a slight
                                            increase in pulse rate. </p>

                                            study
                                            gDNA has been extracted and purified from diverse biological samples such as
                                            plant,
                                            bacteria (gram negative and gram positive),
                                            human blood,
                                            fungi and scorpion tissues. The concentration of DNA was determined using
                                            quantus fluorimeter. The integrity of DNA was determined by Gel
                                            electrophoresis.

                                            dermatological disorder “hair loss”. Cuscuta reflexa is a parasitic
                                            plant used
                                            as an herbal medicine traditionally for different diseases such as
                                            headache,
                                            itching,
                                            migraine,
                                            epilepsy,
                                            prolonged fever,
                                            constipation,

                                            alopecia was reported. Therefore,
                                            we are interested in focusing on the application of this plant for hair
                                            growth.
                                            This study consists of two parts experimental and theoretical;
                                            experimental part comprises of chemical analysis of Cuscuta reflexa,
                                            and its application and/or activity. Chemical analysis was done by using
                                            liquid
                                            chromatography and HPLC,
                                            while the application and/or activity part was carried out using Albino
                                            Mice.
                                            The theoretical/computational part was carried out using “Bioinformatics
                                            tools”
                                            for the determination of specific proteins causing Alopecia and protein

                                                    provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of Parkinson’s disease
                                                    on the molecular level and also cellular and biological levels by
                                                    pathway enrichment analysis. Recently findings of this study show
                                                    the involvement of DEGs in the Cancer pathway with a p-value of
                                                    4.50E-02, which is selected as it is the most significantly enriched
                                                    pathway having the highest gene count as compared to other principle
                                                    pathways. A potential diagnostic bio-marker may be helpful in
                                                    diagnosing patients earlier so they may receive more effective

                                                    Honey is a thick, sweet fluid produced by bees from plant
                                                    nectars. It is
                                                    commonly used as a
                                                    sweetener in food. Honey has various medicinal importance due to
                                                    the
                                                    presence of vital
                                                    biomolecules like (Sugar, proteins, vitamin, mineral, and
                                                    enzyme) that
                                                    are
                                                    produced by plant,
                                                    honeybee and bacterial flora of honeybee. The healing property
                                                    of honey
                                                    is
                                                    due to the fact that it
                                                    offers antibacterial activity, maintains a moist wound
                                                    condition, and
                                                    its
                                                    high viscosity helps to
                                                    provide a protective barrier to prevent infection. Its

                                                    property is relevant to
                                                    wound repair too. Honey exhibits a broad-spectrum of
                                                    antibacterial
                                                    activity
                                                    against both Grampositive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria,
                                                    including
                                                    antibiotic-resistant (MRSA) ones. Honey
                                                    has been shown to have a strong activity against many bacteria
                                                    in both

                                                    and in culture. There
                                                    are numerous types of honeybees in Pakistan, but some common
                                                    types are,
                                                    Apis
                                                    dorsata, Apis
                                                    cerana, and Apis florea. Apis mellifera is imported and settled
                                                    in
                                                    Pakistan.
                                                    The honeybee gut
                                                    microbiota is dominated by eight bacterial species:
                                                    Lactobacillus spp.
                                                    Firm-4, Lactobacillus spp.
                                                    Firm-5 (phylum Firmicutes), Bifidobacterium spp. (phylum
                                                    Actinobacteria),

                                                    (phylum Proteobacteria).
                                                    These bacteria lives in harsh environment of honey. The aim of
                                                    the
                                                    present
                                                    study was to check the
                                                    survival and tolerance of honeybee gut bacteria in sugar
                                                    environment of
                                                    honey. For this purpose,
                                                    bacteria were isolated from honeybee gut and were stored in
                                                    glycerol
                                                    solution at -20O C. These
                                                    bacteria were then grown in LB agar. Now from this LB agar
                                                    plate, a
                                                    discrete
                                                    colony of bacteria
                                                    were inoculated in the LB broth and grown in LB broth. To check
                                                    sugar
                                                    tolerance, sugar rich media
                                                    was prepared with different concentration of glucose (5%, 10%,
                                                    15%, 20%
                                                    and
                                                    30%). From LB
                                                    broth, these bacteria were then transferred into the sugar rich
                                                    media
                                                    containing different sugars
                                                    (Glucose and sucrose). Then the absorbance was taken using 96
                                                    well plate
                                                    with 2hrs intervals (such
                                                    as 1hr, 3hrs and 5hrs) at 630nm. These results were shown in the
                                                    form of
                                                    bar
                                                    graph. Out of thirty
                                                    strain, eight strains (4B2, 8k, 2BB, 4A, 3B, 5a, 4a and 7e) were
                                                    found
                                                    to be
                                                    tolerant to high sugar
                                                    concentration (Glucose & sucrose) while six strains (1AA, 4E,
                                                    3D, 6a, 5b
                                                    and
                                                    8g) are susceptible
                                                    to sugar. These results showed that these bacteria can survive
                                                    under the
                                                    harsh environment of honey.
                                                    In order to confirm the results, several microbiological tests
                                                    were
                                                    carried
                                                    out by growing bacteria
