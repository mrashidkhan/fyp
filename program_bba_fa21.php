                                            identify how the inventory is operating efficiently and effectively with the
                                            help of digitization. We have identified a problem in the inventory
                                            management of Dream Network and Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (DNTPL) where we have
                                            noticed that this organization (DNTPL) is not using a proper system for its
                                            whole inventory management. They have no idea how much stock they have in
                                            their stock right now. They only maintain a system for the inventory they
                                            have sold out but they also have an inventory deployed for projects. These
                                            projects may be for a longer period or shorter period. The actual
                                            discrepancy for inventory management is here. They have no system that can
                                            tell how much inventory is stuck in a project and how much is exactly
                                            available in the stock right now. Furthermore, we have gathered data from
                                            both sources i.e. primary and secondary. Primary source is the direct
                                            interview and meeting with the DNTPL management and secondary source of data
                                            is internet research, paper reading, literature review and books.

                                            characterized as one of the most influential sectors across the world.
                                            Employee retention refers to an organization's voluntary decision to build
                                            an environment that retains its core employees engaged for a longer period
                                            of time. Retention of employees has become one of the major challenges faced
                                            by the firms and because of this employee turnover increases. Employee
                                            turnover increases the risk of losing good staff. Therefore, to retain
                                            skilled employees is very important for the organization’s performance and
                                            success.
                                            PURPOSE: The research was conducted to examine the factors that influence
                                            the employee retention and turnover in the pharmaceutical sectors, using
                                            GETZ Pharma as the context. It determines the issues and challenges from the
                                            employees’ perception and to explore whether the company has adequate
                                            retention policies to retain their employees. The findings will be valuable
                                            for companies striving to increase job satisfaction and are concerned to
                                            retain their employees. The study may help the policy makers find out the
                                            different approaches in dealing with retention issues and help the
                                            management with appropriate guidance for effective retention strategies.
                                            METHOD: The outcome of this study is derived from the collection of primary
                                            information. Qualitative approach has been used to conduct in-depth
                                            interviews with the Territory Managers of GETZ Pharma. Structured research
                                            questions were developed based on the literature to investigate the major
                                            issue, and these related to career advancement, compensation, skill
                                            recognition, stress at workplace, training etc. open-ended questions were
                                            also encouraged to acquire the wider grasp of thoughts and employees’
                                            experiences. FINDINGS: The results of this paper shows that employees of
                                            GETZ Pharma are dissatisfied with some of the factors that influence their
                                            decision to stay or leave in the organization.
                                            They emphasize on unusual working hours or work-life imbalance, less gross
                                            salaries. The company has implemented the retention strategies but somehow
                                            from the employees’ perception, the company lacks in providing these
                                            factors. It is important for the organization to make the employees feel
                                            satisfied which will ultimately increase their productivity and performance
                                            of the organization.

                                            we move any further in this project. Electronic banking has many different
                                            meanings depending on who you ask and where you get your information, and
                                            the term "e-banking" is no exception. This field is also home to a slew of
                                            jargon. These might refer to quite different things, the same thing, or even
                                            overlap in certain cases. "EBanking," "Net Banking," "Online Banking," "Home
                                            Banking," "PC Banking," and "PC Banking" are all terms that may be found in
                                            the lexicon, although "E-Banking" is not the only one. Some banks began
                                            offering E-banking to consumers in 1985; however, the lack of internet users
                                            and the greater cost of electronic banking have stifled the expansion of
                                            online banking, according to Bob Batchelor. However, the internet boom led
                                            to the introduction of online banking in Shangrila food pvt. Since 2000, 80

                                        </p>Nowadays living without electricity is not possible so to run a textile mill
                                        electricity is the most important input we need today. In Pakistan, textile
                                        industry is the very early adopter of renewable energy and has contributed to
                                        clean energy in the country. We have seen that many textile industries have set
                                        windmills and captive solar plants to run their mills efficiently. In Pakistan,
                                        solar systems are getting common nowadays. People are getting familiar with the
                                        advantages of solar panels, after watching the benefits of solar energy so many
                                        textile industries have decided to invest in solar systems in a big way. Textile
                                        industries are going towards solar energy because it is one of the cheapest
                                        sources of energy, they can get to run the industry. We can see that now many
                                        companies provide a solar system in the country and they give the warranty of
                                        their products. In Pakistan, the electricity tariff is quite high and it is very
                                        difficult for the company to run its operations on grid power. The price of
                                        solar energy minimizes their profit. Solar power tariff remains almost the same
                                        so that’s why it is also known as one of the cheapest forms of energy, in our
                                        country we can see that our conversational source tariff increases year on year.

                                        dangerous for the types of machinery which cost millions of dollars. Tata
                                        Pakistan thought on this matter a lot like on what they should run the company,
                                        so they thought of running the operations on diesel but the cost of diesel is
                                        increasing day by day, and the cost of generators and their maintenance is also
                                        very much high, and the pollution caused from the diesel generators is also
                                        dangerous for the atmosphere. Due to these reasons, Tata Pakistan is trying to
                                        shift its energy use from electricity and diesel to solar power energy. Due to
                                        these reasons Tata Pakistan is trying to shift its energy use from electricity
                                        and diesel to solar power energy. Implementation of solar panels will help the
                                        Tata textile industry in saving a heavy amount monthly, which was spent on
                                        electricity bill and on diesel cost. Implementation of solar panels is the one
                                        time expense for the company but it will benefit the company in many ways.
                                        Tata textile Mill decided to change its performance from diesel generators and
                                        move from k-electric to solar power systems to increase its profitability and
                                        eliminate dependence on generators and k electricity. For example, most
                                        companies are trying to set up their own power stations. Some leading textile
                                        companies produce their own electricity to avoid these situations. The
                                        government should encourage larger units to generate energy and supply them with
                                        smaller units.

                                            growing textile industry which requires financing facility to purchase a
                                            property from Meezan Bank. They required financing to expand their business,
                                            production capacity and meet the customer demands on a timely basis. Energy
                                            crisis, surge in cash outflows, unusual expenses, and continuous fluctuation
                                            in the rate of dollar are also the other factors which makes Akram Textile
                                            to go for the financing from the Bank. We are three people who represent
                                            Akram Textile and try to get the financing to be done for them. Despite all
                                            the factors, Akram Textile has performed brilliantly in their short period
                                            of time in the Industry; Gul Ahmed, Yunus Textile and Deen Textile are their
                                            competitors as Akram Textile matches nearly all of them in a short period of
                                            time. They have one office in DHA which is on rent, so now they require
                                            another property in S.I.T.E Area in order to increase its production
                                            capacity. The management of Akram Textile wanted financing from any leading
                                            Islamic bank because they wanted to avoid typical conventional banking.
                                            Speaking about Meezan Bank, the most important element for them is to look
                                            at the company's credit history in which they were able to see whether they
                                            would be able to pay back the financing amount or not. They would look at
                                            all the factors which are included in the evaluation of credit risk to make
                                            sure that the company has no credit issues and no outstanding loan shown on
                                            their statement. Bank further checks e-CIB portals by looking at all the
                                            credit data of the company till date. Meezan Bank would be financing the
                                            property to Akram Textile under the contract of diminishing Musharakah,
                                            where both Bank and company made partnership in the property and after that,
                                            bank would ultimately sell its shares in the property to the company in the
                                            form of units.
                                            Mr. Arshad Hussain, the sales & Marketing manager of Akram Textile founds
                                            few properties where all the relevant documents are completed and have
                                            proper leased from concerned authorities. After completion of all the
                                            background work, CEO of the company Mr. Muhammad Akram presented the
                                            proposal to Board of Directors Meeting for requiring its approval for
                                            availing financing from bank. The Board duly approved the resolution and
                                            advised the Management to select the suitable bank which would be able to
                                            give us a desired financing of property. Akram Textile started its
                                            methodology by Interviewing, Reading Sales manuals, evaluating Quotation
                                            Sheets, getting feedback from counterparts, and visiting websites of Meezan
                                            Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, Bank Islami, HBL Islamic and MCB Islamic. We
                                            rejected the MCB Islamic and HBL Islamic straight after they forced us to
                                            avail conventional Style of financing. With careful consideration and
                                            evaluation, we have decided to choose Meezan bank as our financer, the
                                            reason for choosing them is purely because of positive attitude of their
                                            sales manager Mr. Arif Shabbir and providing reasonably good rates to us. He
                                            also assured that Meezan Bank would also help to find us a property which
                                            they will find soon in S.I.T.E area around 250 Sq yards.
                                            This disbursement of financing would surely help Akram Textile to expand
                                            their business and also would be helpful to manage the cash outflows in a
                                            better way.

                                            combination of the English
                                            and Italian word Art & Regalo (Regalo is an Italian word which means gift or
                                            present). Artregalo
                                            works on handmade home decors, jewelry, quilling art, bottle art and much
                                            more completely by
                                            hand. The demand for handmade products is rising day by day because it is
                                            environmentally friendly,
                                            attractive, unique, better quality and better designs. All these are the
                                            reasons that people are looking
                                            more towards handicrafts.In this report we share our personal experiences
                                            throughout the start of
                                            business and we also collect data from different publications, internet
                                            sources and student papers. In
                                            writing this report we have some limitations like privacy and hesitancy. We
                                            also have limitations
                                            like the lackness of resources, adequate capital investment, less knowledge
                                            of Social media
                                            platforms for marketing and creating prominent brand awareness. As discussed
                                            Artregalo is an
                                            online business and nowadays online business is capturing the market.
                                            Artregalo uses different
                                            online platforms to run business which includes official E-commerce website,
                                            Facebook page,
                                            Instagram page and Youtube Channel. The reason to run an online business is
                                            to provide a vast range
                                            of products easily accessible for the consumers to purchase on our social
                                            media platforms through
                                            the internet. The other benefit of online business is that it saves
                                            customers time. In this report we
                                            identified that the biggest problem of Artregalo is we are lacking a strong
                                            brand awareness strategy.
                                            To overcome this problem we worked on customers (who are they), Quality of
                                            product, retail brand,
                                            logo (for prominent brand identity). Behind the success of any business you
                                            must know each and
                                            everything about the market, especially about your competitors and we also
                                            must know about our
                                            strengths and weaknesses so we have done complete SWOT/ PEST analysis,
                                            problems, future
                                            problems and their likely solutions, opportunities for our business and
                                            brand.

                                            This technology came and resolved every issue related to seepage and leakage
                                            (Provided proper
                                            installation was done) this technology PPR-C was based on heat fusion
                                            technology. A special kind
                                            of machine uses fusion technology, a special kind of machine is used for the

                                            fitting. Once these pipes and fittings are installed, they can be tested by
                                            water pressure with on
                                            equipment. After the test is successful, the chances of leakage and seepage
                                            are completely eliminated
                                            (provided workmanship is done properly) Eternal group of industries

                                            In cities around the world, food is turning into a basic luxury for the
                                            unfortunate and middle class
                                            people. Food supply chain system highly depends on extensive transpiration
                                            and high energy
                                            consuming procedures and requirement of making agricultural products
                                            available to consumers in
                                            urban areas. This means that in cities there are food supply chains highly
                                            dependent on resource
                                            imports. However modern cities are now converting into productive systems.
                                            Urban agriculture is
                                            on the rise and governments all around the world are devising new
                                            institutional policies and making
                                            changes to other policies so that all activities related to urban
                                            agriculture are recognized, managed
                                            and promoted. Urban farming is not something entirely new, rather it’s been
                                            around from centuries
                                            and in fact just like the cities themselves urban agriculture techniques are
                                            ancient as well. Number
                                            of benefits that can be achieved by utilizing households for food
                                            production. These benefits range
                                            from improved nutritional status of urban residents and their general health
                                            to improved savings and
                                            income. That is the reason that these activities can potentially lead to the
                                            development of assistance
                                            organizations and authorities that will include urban agriculture activities
                                            into the list of more
                                            sustainable and cost effective strategies.

                                            Pakistan. Cryptocurrencies are undeniably a significant and growing part of
                                            today's digital economy.
                                            Cryptocurrency is rising in Pakistan too. Its first currency name is “Pak
                                            Coin '' which was launched
                                            in 2015. Pakistan has 60-70 percent infrastructure for introducing a digital
                                            currency. Over the last
                                            two years, Pakistan has improved its compliance with 27 items of the FATF
                                            action plan. Islamabad
                                            was expected to be included to the FATF's white list. Strict surveillance to

                                            such as the one with which
                                            every modern economy is currently engaged. Cryptocurrency is the currency
                                            sector market, and this
                                            industry is quickly expanding around the world. Pakistan has had an
                                            extraordinarily thrilling path
                                            towards leading change by getting on the cryptocurrency adoption.<br>
                                            This report is written about the Rain Cryptocurrency platform. The country's
                                            first cryptocurrency
                                            trading platform, "Rain," was scheduled to start, with all of the necessary
                                            formalities in place. Rain
                                            claims to be the first cryptocurrency exchange in the Middle East to receive
                                            a governmental license,
                                            as well as a member of an "exclusive group of exchanges globally."
                                            Pakistanis were able to buy and
                                            trade cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and others in a
                                            "safe and easy" manner
                                            through the Bahrain-based company. The company claimed to have created the
                                            platform on a
                                            "robust, scalable, and resilient" infrastructure that includes safeguards,
                                            services, and capabilities to
                                            make bitcoin investing simple and secure for Pakistanis. <br>
                                            "Rain's launch in Pakistan came at a critical moment in the market's
                                            evolution, when people urgently
                                            require a licensed and regulated cryptocurrency trading platform." The goal
                                            was to make
                                            cryptocurrency trading in the country incredibly secure, simple, and
                                            cost-effective for all present
                                            and potential crypto-traders." If Rain had to launch in Pakistan, it could
                                            have had the monopoly as
                                            there is not any registered Cryptocurrency platform available here like
                                            Binance, Coinbase, Kraken
                                            and BilBox in the world. Rain has already listed many cryptocurrencies, and
                                            the number is growing
                                            every day which could attract Pakistanis. It also provides crypto asset
                                            custodian services. Rain users
                                            would have to fill out a "know-your-customer" application form before being
                                            able to transact. When
                                            People will be having business with Rain, A lot of transactions can be run
                                            of crypto currency at a
                                            time but due to its scalability there is no guarantee of smoothness of
                                            transaction. If Rain had run its
                                            business in Pakistan, it could have been beneficial for Pakistan. But there
                                            are some limitations of
                                            Rain to start its business in Pakistan. As this was banned by the Government
                                            of Pakistan. The
                                            Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan is the final authority in the
                                            country for giving
                                            licenses to exchange companies. The Commission indeed granted a license to
                                            the said company to
                                            operate in the region. But it is wrongful to say that it is Pakistan’s
                                            first-ever company to have
                                            received a license. Nobody can run their own exchanges, according to the
                                            State Bank of Pakistan
                                            and SECP. Another reason which is a barrier on the way of Rain to start its
                                            business in Pakistan is
                                            the Halal or Haram of cryptocurrency. As most of the Ulamas are silent on
                                            this but there is a Fatwa
                                            from Malaysia about it that crypto is not Halal in any means.
