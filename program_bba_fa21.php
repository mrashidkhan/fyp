                                            identify how the inventory is operating efficiently and effectively with the
                                            help of digitization. We have identified a problem in the inventory
                                            management of Dream Network and Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (DNTPL) where we have
                                            noticed that this organization (DNTPL) is not using a proper system for its
                                            whole inventory management. They have no idea how much stock they have in
                                            their stock right now. They only maintain a system for the inventory they
                                            have sold out but they also have an inventory deployed for projects. These
                                            projects may be for a longer period or shorter period. The actual
                                            discrepancy for inventory management is here. They have no system that can
                                            tell how much inventory is stuck in a project and how much is exactly
                                            available in the stock right now. Furthermore, we have gathered data from
                                            both sources i.e. primary and secondary. Primary source is the direct
                                            interview and meeting with the DNTPL management and secondary source of data
                                            is internet research, paper reading, literature review and books.

                                            characterized as one of the most influential sectors across the world.
                                            Employee retention refers to an organization's voluntary decision to build
                                            an environment that retains its core employees engaged for a longer period
                                            of time. Retention of employees has become one of the major challenges faced
                                            by the firms and because of this employee turnover increases. Employee
                                            turnover increases the risk of losing good staff. Therefore, to retain
                                            skilled employees is very important for the organization’s performance and
                                            success.
                                            PURPOSE: The research was conducted to examine the factors that influence
                                            the employee retention and turnover in the pharmaceutical sectors, using
                                            GETZ Pharma as the context. It determines the issues and challenges from the
                                            employees’ perception and to explore whether the company has adequate
                                            retention policies to retain their employees. The findings will be valuable
                                            for companies striving to increase job satisfaction and are concerned to
                                            retain their employees. The study may help the policy makers find out the
                                            different approaches in dealing with retention issues and help the
                                            management with appropriate guidance for effective retention strategies.
                                            METHOD: The outcome of this study is derived from the collection of primary
                                            information. Qualitative approach has been used to conduct in-depth
                                            interviews with the Territory Managers of GETZ Pharma. Structured research
                                            questions were developed based on the literature to investigate the major
                                            issue, and these related to career advancement, compensation, skill
                                            recognition, stress at workplace, training etc. open-ended questions were
                                            also encouraged to acquire the wider grasp of thoughts and employees’
                                            experiences. FINDINGS: The results of this paper shows that employees of
                                            GETZ Pharma are dissatisfied with some of the factors that influence their
                                            decision to stay or leave in the organization.

                                            salaries. The company has implemented the retention strategies but somehow
                                            from the employees’ perception, the company lacks in providing these
                                            factors. It is important for the organization to make the employees feel
                                            satisfied which will ultimately increase their productivity and performance
                                            of the organization.

                                        electricity is the most important input we need today. In Pakistan, textile

                                        solar systems are getting common nowadays. People are getting familiar with the
                                        advantages of solar panels, after watching the benefits of solar energy so many
                                        textile industries have decided to invest in solar systems in a big way. Textile
                                        industries are going towards solar energy because it is one of the cheapest
                                        sources of energy, they can get to run the industry. We can see that now many
                                        companies provide a solar system in the country and they give the warranty of
                                        their products. In Pakistan, the electricity tariff is quite high and it is very
                                        difficult for the company to run its operations on grid power. The price of
                                        solar energy minimizes their profit. Solar power tariff remains almost the same
                                        so that’s why it is also known as one of the cheapest forms of energy, in our
                                        country we can see that our conversational source tariff increases year on year.
                                        Due to the increase in rates of electricity and diesel Tata, the textile
                                        industry is trying to shift its operations to solar energy. Because of running
                                        the types of machinery on electricity and diesel company’s expense is increasing
                                        and due to shortage of electricity in the country, the company is facing a lot
                                        of problems like all the operations stop due to fluctuation and it's very
                                        dangerous for the types of machinery which cost millions of dollars. Tata
                                        Pakistan thought on this matter a lot like on what they should run the company,
                                        so they thought of running the operations on diesel but the cost of diesel is
                                        increasing day by day, and the cost of generators and their maintenance is also
                                        very much high, and the pollution caused from the diesel generators is also
                                        dangerous for the atmosphere. Due to these reasons, Tata Pakistan is trying to
                                        shift its energy use from electricity and diesel to solar power energy. Due to
                                        these reasons Tata Pakistan is trying to shift its energy use from electricity
                                        and diesel to solar power energy. Implementation of solar panels will help the
                                        Tata textile industry in saving a heavy amount monthly, which was spent on
                                        electricity bill and on diesel cost. Implementation of solar panels is the one
                                        time expense for the company but it will benefit the company in many ways.
                                        Tata textile Mill decided to change its performance from diesel generators and
                                        move from k-electric to solar power systems to increase its profitability and
                                        eliminate dependence on generators and k electricity. For example, most
                                        companies are trying to set up their own power stations. Some leading textile
                                        companies produce their own electricity to avoid these situations. The
                                        government should encourage larger units to generate energy and supply them with
                                        smaller units.

                                            they can get the advantage concerning time & cost saving. Warehousing is
                                            running very traditionally due to which we are facing a lot of issues. But
                                            it will become a complete end solution to their customers. Warehousing is
                                            continuously developing and more adoption and automation is required to
                                            fulfill the need of the increasing population.

                                            In cities around the world, food is turning into a basic luxury for the
                                            unfortunate and middle class
                                            people. Food supply chain system highly depends on extensive transpiration
                                            and high energy
                                            consuming procedures and requirement of making agricultural products
                                            available to consumers in
                                            urban areas. This means that in cities there are food supply chains highly
                                            dependent on resource
                                            imports. However modern cities are now converting into productive systems.
                                            Urban agriculture is
                                            on the rise and governments all around the world are devising new
                                            institutional policies and making
                                            changes to other policies so that all activities related to urban
                                            agriculture are recognized, managed
                                            and promoted. Urban farming is not something entirely new, rather it’s been
                                            around from centuries
                                            and in fact just like the cities themselves urban agriculture techniques are
                                            ancient as well. Number
                                            of benefits that can be achieved by utilizing households for food
                                            production. These benefits range
                                            from improved nutritional status of urban residents and their general health
                                            to improved savings and
                                            income. That is the reason that these activities can potentially lead to the
                                            development of assistance
                                            organizations and authorities that will include urban agriculture activities
                                            into the list of more
                                            sustainable and cost effective strategies.
