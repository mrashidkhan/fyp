                                            Logistics is gaining more attention. It is a vital role of
                                            Supply Chain Management and plays an important part in the improvement of
                                            shipping, logistics
                                            activities and production. It serves as an enabler of growth in business and
                                            trade in an economy
                                            because it is a helpful ingredient for economic transactions. Logistics is
                                            described as the process of
                                            forecasting, executing, and controlling the efficient, economical flow of
                                            goods and process inventory.

                                            strategies. This paper tells us
                                            about how we can adopt green logistics as an opportunity in an economy where
                                            green logistics is
                                            very rarely implemented. Soorty Enterprises which is a denim manufacturing

                                            disease that is now causing havoc around the globe. It was
                                            initially reported in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The
                                            pandemic afflicted everyone,
                                            causing a global crisis in all industries. With the COVID 19, businesses are
                                            obliged to adapt and adjust
                                            to the new normal in order to survive in the new environment. The Harvard
                                            Business Review clarifies
                                            how organizations that put resources into perceivability across their
                                            worldwide groups and
                                            organizations are better ready to react to disturbances, and how

                                            out from one to two degrees (the provider) or more to successfully oversee

                                            decreasing the quantity of possible interruptions and expanding inventory
                                            network versatility.
                                            In order to compensate for a lack of supplier diversification, small
                                            enterprises may rely on visibility.
                                            Diversification of suppliers is not always possible for SMEs to mitigate the
                                            risk of supply disruption.
                                            Integrating a complete visibility solution into their supply chain is the
                                            answer.

                                            vital role for manufacturing business. The reason is that
                                            the core function of any manufacturing company is to produce the best
                                            quality products. And the
                                            second important factor for the business is to deliver the produced goods to
                                            the customer safely.
                                            Here the importance of distributors is visible. The distributors make and
                                            work on a strong route riding
                                            model through which they deliver goods from the manufacturer to their
                                            customers safely.
                                            The case critically defines the real-life scenario of Burque Corporation. It
                                            defines how the
                                            organization faces problems in their existing process that create trouble
                                            for the company. It also
                                            defines that if the problem when highlighted is not solved at the right
                                            moment it can create hurdles
                                            for the organization. The real-life scenarios as discussed in this case help

                                            gain practical knowledge from the findings. The case has tried to shed light
                                            upon the initiatives that
                                            were taken by the HR team to overcome the challenges. Also, the results of
                                            those steps were focused
                                            on identifying whether the initiatives that were taken were proved to be
                                            fruitful for the company or
                                            not. Further, the study also defines the period it took to overcome the
                                            challenges.

                                            having a traditional outlook, its values, and variety of food. Lal Qila is
                                            striving continuously to achieve

                                            The determination of conducting this project is to know about the current
                                            practices, procedures, and
                                            process flow of Lal Qila restaurant to analyze them in the context of

                                            human capital, structural capital, and relational capital, and to identify

                                            This project is based on experiential learning. In this, I have worked in
                                            Lal Qila restaurant with all its
                                            departments to know their processes and procedures and to get the actual
                                            insight of it. The reason
                                            for selecting a method of experiential learning is to get deep insight,
                                            understand and observe the
                                            actual processes and its challenges in the daily operations of the
                                            restaurant to get, examine and
                                            analyze the collected information for better and effective results.<br>
                                            The findings of this project reveal that the Lal Qila restaurant is trying
                                            its level best to achieve
                                            excellence and now it is in a developing stage, and it is trying to adopt
                                            best practices to improve the
                                            overall performance of the organization. It is also found that Lal Qila is
                                            using its ambiance of
                                            traditional look as a competitive advantage in the market.

                                            whether the replacement of Old Dornier Plain Air Jet Looms
                                            with New Picanol Air Jet Looms is financially feasible or not. Orient
                                            Textile Mills Ltd wants to increase
                                            its weaving production capacity. In fact, the existing production capacity
                                            of weaving looms is still
                                            limited and not comparable with increasing demand from the market.
                                            Therefore, to meet the current
                                            and expected future export orders management of the company intends to
                                            replace old Dornier Air
                                            Jet Looms with Picanol Air Jet Looms. This will help in increase in
                                            production capacity, production
                                            efficiency and as well as its profitability. <br>
                                            In order to draw a conclusion, this research was conducted to carry out
                                            investment analysis of new
                                            machines. Capital appraisal techniques used which include Accounting Rate of
                                            Return, Payback
                                            period, NPV, IRR and Profitability Index. The results show that Total
                                            Project Accounting Rate of
                                            Return is 18.42%, Payback Period is 3.23 years, Total project NPV is Rs.
                                            1,168,241,825/-, Internal Rate
                                            of Return of the project is 27.70% and Profitability Index is 2.15
                                            times.<br>
                                            However, this feasibility study has a few limitations. First, it does not
                                            consider other than Picanol
                                            Looms which may include Toyota Looms, Tsudakoma Looms, etc. Second, it does
                                            not consider new
                                            infrastructure cost because in my feasibility study we are working on
                                            replacement of old looms with
                                            new looms on existing infrastructure. However, these limitations may
                                            represent an important basis
                                            for future research.<br>

                                            This study contributes, in various ways, to enriching existing literature.
                                            In addition to analyze the
                                            project financially by using Decision making techniques, this study broadens
                                            the scope of application
                                            of Investment Appraisement in the textile industry of Pakistan, currently
                                            underused to interpret the
                                            phenomena in relation to capital investment decision techniques.<br>
                                            After a detailed analysis, I recommend to the management of Orient Textile
                                            Mills Ltd to replace Old
                                            Dornier Looms with New Picanol Looms as per plan because it is financially
                                            viable and it will
                                            strengthen the company's competitive position in the current competitive
                                            environment by
                                            enhancing its production capacity and profitability.

                                            The Supply chain is now known as a critical area of any organization’s
                                            success. This plays a key role
                                            in organization’s strategic planning. This involves tasks such as planning,
                                            procurement, warehousing,
                                            logistics, and quality control. If in any organization this task performs
                                            efficiently and effectively it will
                                            minimize process time, cost, reduce delay in processes, and provide
                                            acceptable services to their
                                            customers. Warehouse management is the key component of the supply chain.
                                            The purpose of
                                            warehousing is to store raw material and finished goods. It would be more
                                            costly for the organization
                                            if the goods are not stored with efficient planning. The aim of this project
                                            is to measure the
                                            performance of the company. Our target was to find a company with a
                                            warehouse, analyze their
                                            warehouse issues and also suggest solutions to those problems. We have
                                            decided to choose Union
                                            Fabrics warehouse for this project. Union is a denim textile and garment
                                            industry and one of the
                                            leading denim exporters of Pakistan. I have visited their warehouse Mr
                                            Shahzaib Shafi (Warehouse
                                            manager) briefed about the warehouse. I interviewed and also observed their
                                            working procedure
                                            that they use. To find out the issues I observed the warehouse in detail.
                                            There are different problems
                                            that I identify which include an un-efficient and lack of racking system,
                                            lack of technologies, lack of
                                            capacity and lack of safety in the warehouse. After identifying these
                                            problems I study, gather
                                            information and try to give them the best possible solutions for these
                                            problems. All the best possible
                                            solutions are provided on the basis of standard follows in warehousing, our
                                            studies regarding
                                            warehouse and market working process. The whole collection of data and
                                            suggested approaches are
                                            based on findings and our group discussions. The main goal of this project
                                            is to raise business
                                            awareness regarding appropriate warehousing, its importance, and its impact
                                            on company
                                            performance. Also, to examine problems and make appropriate recommendations
                                            in order to
                                            function successfully and efficiently.

                                            In the banking business, justice with workers is also a vital aspect that
                                            enhances employee happiness
                                            and performance. Inequality decisions hinder employee productivity and have
                                            both good and bad
                                            effects on the workplace and organization. Thus, one of the major issues
                                            most businesses and sectors
                                            confront is ensuring equal treatment for all workers. While high levels of
                                            trust ensure managers and
                                            staff execute their duties, it also enables employees to freely exchange
                                            ideas and information. As a
                                            result, they may be more open to sharing their thoughts and working together
                                            to achieve
                                            organizational objectives and goals. Especially for individuals who operate
                                            in an atmosphere of trust
                                            and honesty more at ease while expressing their emotions, communicating,
                                            ideas or opinions. Thus,
                                            communication is vital in the banking industry for staff to communicate with
                                            supervisors.
                                            Methods:The researcher will use both primary and secondary data sources to
                                            analyze the issue.
                                            Interviews will be the major source of data collection for the researcher
                                            (Lin et al., 2018).
                                            Alternatively, workplace mindfulness may be used to gather secondary data on
                                            the influence of
                                            job engagement and organizational justice on employee well-being. Use
                                            legitimate websites,
                                            research articles and journals by Emerald, academia, or Google Scholar.

                                            The restaurant industry is an important socioeconomic sector that makes a
                                            significant contribution
                                            to the economy. This study evaluates the impact of COVID-19 on the
                                            restaurant business that how
                                            the restaurant business affected due to lockdown by the government, lack of
                                            imported products due
                                            to complete ban on import by the government and the hyperinflation created
                                            by the traders also
                                            effected the restaurant badly. According to the study, as governments
                                            throughout the world
                                            implemented social distancing programs, movement restrictions, and lockdowns
                                            resulting in the loss
                                            of millions of jobs and billions of dollars in potential revenue. This
                                            research shows that how the
                                            restaurant industry suffered in Pakistan at the time of pandemic and how
                                            they recover after the end
                                            of this horrible period. In this research interview were conducted with
                                            multiple restaurant
                                            stockholders like owners or supply chain managers. Some restaurant named as
                                            under Lalqila, Café
                                            the rocks and pancakes, Chatterbox café and Chai Deewari. At the end of this
                                            research, we conclude
                                            that how the restaurants were effect and what are the major reasons for
                                            their loss at this bad time.
                                            After this research, we suggest some recommendations that what are the
                                            precautionary majors the
                                            restaurant industry can manage by which they can prevent that much loss for
                                            the industry if the
                                            pandemic like this hit back again ever. We also recommend government that
                                            how they take
                                            precautionary majors in the future to take some safety majors for the
                                            restaurant industry. Our
                                            research also supports the society to conduct the research on the different
                                            industries of Pakistan, as
                                            this research is only base on the restaurant of Pakistan.

                                            project report is M/s. Xpert Services (Private) Limited. This
                                            is a Private Limited company that has been incorporated with the Securities
                                            and Exchange
                                            Commission of Pakistan under section 32 of the Companies Ordinance 1984 on
                                            the 23rd of February
                                            2005. The company’s office is in Karachi. The principal line of their
                                            business is that they provide
                                            trained, skilled, and unskilled persons. The reason I have chosen this
                                            company is that it was accessible
                                            to me. The main purpose of this research was to study the company and
                                            identify the problems being
                                            faced by them. For this purpose, a detailed interview was conducted through
                                            which the problems
                                            came to light. The problems identified are selection of the right fit, long
                                            duration/ period to hire,
                                            applicants who are receiving other offers from other firms and facing a
                                            scam. After identifying the
                                            problems this case study also helps in how these issues/ problems could be
                                            solved by the
                                            recommendations given in the report. The recommendations that I have given
                                            are that the company
                                            should switch their use of traditional methods to modern methods, while
                                            reviewing the list of
                                            applicants they should remove the idea of perfect or ideal candidates and
                                            instead look for someone
                                            who would turn into prominent employees, third they should also target
                                            passive candidates, fourth
                                            they should streamline their process and start pre- planning. Also a proper
                                            research should be done
                                            on the candidate to avoid facing a scam. The above discussed recommendations
                                            would help them
                                            overcome the issues faced by them. Also this case study project research has
                                            also some limitations
                                            too. Therefore, the identified gaps will allow us to fill those gaps by
                                            exploring the phenomenon from
                                            other perspectives.

                                            The purpose for this Research is to obtain observant of the inefficiency in

                                            know that the payroll procedure is an imperative process for any
                                            organization; this includes a few
                                            actions to ensure that employees payments for their services are accurate
                                            and timely, and to protect
                                            the organization reputation by effectively complying with government labor
                                            standards. Apart from
                                            its important role in the planning process, payroll processing research is
                                            rather limited compared to
                                            other transaction processing systems such as sales and purchases, etc. This
                                            project aims to develop

                                            2018. This study aims to use bibliometric analysis to provide information on
                                            the characteristics of
                                            wage problems in Covid-19. Apprenticeships that matched with the keywords

                                            research papers has been obtained and investigated. Once the cleanup process
                                            is complete, it
                                            involves inserting survey metadata and deleting some scan and other simple
                                            options. Paid

                                            Now when I started doing
                                            research on this topic, first I gathered all the issues I personally
                                            experienced in the payroll
                                            department during that pandemic as if I’m working in payroll department
                                            since 2017. With the help

                                            of my personal experience I found out some critical issues that was creating
                                            major glitches and
                                            hurdles in payroll management System. Issues like; Employees Leaves

                                            have almost been resolved. The output of this project can help researchers
                                            to understand the
                                            landscape of the global research on disputes and hurdles on payroll
                                            management systems due to

                                            The main purpose of this project is to understand the dynamics of the
                                            performance management
                                            system in the company I have chosen, namely Butlers Bench which is a startup
                                            organization. The
                                            primary goal of this report is to identify the challenges and issues that a
                                            startup service company
                                            faces in implementation of a performance management system and how it can be
                                            overcome. To
                                            fulfill this purpose, I chose this service company which is a startup that
                                            means it’s in business not for
                                            long and the purpose was to identify the issues regarding the employee’s
                                            performance and its
                                            measurement in the startups. During the process of gathering relevant
                                            information, I came to know
                                            that there is absence of a structured performance management system, and it
                                            is limited to
                                            performance review and appraisals without any defined metrics for it. I also
                                            came to know that there
                                            is a communication gap between the management and the staff due to which the
                                            performance of
                                            the employees is getting effective and resulting in negative opinions
                                            sometimes. This study helped
                                            us in recognizing the issues and the root because of it and therefore I was
                                            able to recommend some
                                            solutions for them according to my understanding and limited knowledge. I
                                            hope that this study
                                            serves the purpose of the report and contributes positively to society in
                                            the service sector,
                                            particularly startup.

                                            resolving problems before they become serious in future. In this way looked
                                            at several marketing
                                            methods separately in order to determine the optimal combinations of
                                            effective marketing tactics.
                                            Major competitors such as BBQ Tonight and Areena have captured the biggest
                                            target market,
                                            although the following study has determined that LalQila must adopt several
                                            effective strategies that
                                            they have been currently not concentrating on, such as market penetration,

                                            and, market development, to reclaim its market share and acquire his
                                            targeted audience. In this way
                                            identify several problems like, overprice is charged, Worst customer
                                            services, Generic selling point,

                                            their services, and when
                                            they do, they choose marketing tactics that appear to be beneficial to them.
                                            People seek high quality
                                            meals at reasonable prices, using different pricing strategies followed by

                                            customers to the Lal Qila. Restaurant operators are always looking for ways
                                            to streamline operations
                                            and boost productivity. There are several elements to consider when looking

                                            level of the organization.
                                            For this purpose, I chose Master Molty foam – mattress segment for my
                                            business project. As the
                                            Master Molty Foam is a big organization and I am also working over there,
                                            therefore I chose this
                                            organization. During the interview I conducted it came to my knowledge that
                                            some of the major
                                            challenges the HR have to face is retention of existing employees and new
                                            employees, technological
                                            skill gap, low motivation in employees – skilled labor due to low intrinsic
                                            and extrinsic factors and
                                            the cost involved in talent acquisition. I also got to know that some of
                                            these challenges are tied
                                            directly or indirectly with the finances or budget limitation of the
                                            organization which held utmost
                                            importance in any organization. This study further helps in how these
                                            challenges can be solved by
                                            considering the employees as human capital- an asset to the organization. I
                                            have recommended
                                            some suggestions in this report according to my analysis and understanding
                                            of the problems to
                                            minimize the talent management issues. This can be done by introducing
                                            reward systems and
                                            employee recognition programs, annual increments, training and development
                                            programs and by
                                            giving incentives and other facilities to skilled laborers. This way it will
                                            not only help in retaining
                                            employees but also lower the risk of employees going to their competitor
                                            organization. Further it
                                            will also enhance the skills and abilities of the employees to be utilized
                                            for the progress of the
                                            organization.

                                            with Zoomlion Pakistan, the company financial manager, was conducted for the
                                            primary data. The
                                            goal of this study is to recommend an internal audit evaluation system for
                                            the organization in
                                            question. There were all aspects that should be included in this Audit
                                            Evaluation System.

                                            discovered. The report, on the other hand, includes a few flaws. First,
                                            information on the
                                            manufacturing sector and heavy equipment industry was tough to come by. The
                                            second problem we
                                            experienced was acquiring the Zoomlion
                                            Pakistan and Company some relevant documents, as the companies were hesitant
                                            to share their
                                            information due to confidentiality concerns. Finally, there is just the
                                            layout of a financial expert, which we did not have the opportunity to
                                            construct due to a lack of time and financial skills.
                                            Companies will be educated about the benefits of risk reduction and how to
                                            use it with the help of
                                            this study. Furthermore, they will be educated on how this knowledge would
                                            improve the financial
                                            reporting system, allowing Pakistani businesses to operate in a paperless
                                            atmosphere.
                                            They will be able to obtain financial skill-based employment in this manner.
                                            To recommendation of
                                            the company which factor create issue and used the financial tool and
                                            resolved problem other one
                                            is factor of exchange rate which change forward contract to minimize risk.
                                            The cause for the
                                            modification is due to a change in government policy that affects the
                                            corporate excise duty and tax
                                            rate. Because public policies have such a profound impact on businesses, it
                                            is in their best interests
                                            to keep informed about them and to try to influence government
                                            decision-making and public policy.
                                            It could be a difficult task. Due to limited time and resources to complete
                                            the study.

                                            that made Khaadi an exception from the other retail stores. Recommendations
                                            are made as to how
                                            the ecommerce strategies may enhance Khaadi’s digital approach and build
                                            upon the existing
                                            Ecommerce strategy. The research is informative, in which retail management

                                        Humans require shelter as one of their most basic needs. Slums and informal housing have sprung
up because of Pakistan's fast urbanization. Pakistan's government has announced the
commencement of the NAYA PAKISTAN HOUSING PROGRAM (NPHP), which aims to build 5 million
housing units for low-income Pakistanis by 2023. This study looked at a lot of literature on affordable
housing policies and methods across the world to find the best models for providing inexpensive
housing. Ten professional bankers were interviewed. The cost and amount of land required to build
5 million dwelling units were calculated. In addition, based on expert opinion in the country, this
report examines a few tactics and policies that Naya Pakistan Housing Project might use to deliver 5
million low-income housing units. It is proposed that the site and service model for this project be
practical, and that the government provide substantial subsidies to real estate developers. This study
also proposed the concept of social housing for Pakistan's low-income citizens. This study will be
beneficial to policymakers, urban planners, and housing developers who will directly contribute to
the development of 5 million housing units in the country under the NPHP (Naya Pakistan Housing
Program).
