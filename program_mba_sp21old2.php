                                            Logistics is gaining more attention. It is a vital role of
                                            Supply Chain Management and plays an important part in the improvement of
                                            shipping, logistics
                                            activities and production. It serves as an enabler of growth in business and
                                            trade in an economy
                                            because it is a helpful ingredient for economic transactions. Logistics is
                                            described as the process of
                                            forecasting, executing, and controlling the efficient, economical flow of
                                            goods and process inventory.

                                            strategies. This paper tells us
                                            about how we can adopt green logistics as an opportunity in an economy where
                                            green logistics is
                                            very rarely implemented. Soorty Enterprises which is a denim manufacturing

                                            disease that is now causing havoc around the globe. It was
                                            initially reported in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The
                                            pandemic afflicted everyone,
                                            causing a global crisis in all industries. With the COVID 19, businesses are
                                            obliged to adapt and adjust
                                            to the new normal in order to survive in the new environment. The Harvard
                                            Business Review clarifies
                                            how organizations that put resources into perceivability across their
                                            worldwide groups and
                                            organizations are better ready to react to disturbances, and how

                                            out from one to two degrees (the provider) or more to successfully oversee

                                            decreasing the quantity of possible interruptions and expanding inventory
                                            network versatility.
                                            In order to compensate for a lack of supplier diversification, small
                                            enterprises may rely on visibility.
                                            Diversification of suppliers is not always possible for SMEs to mitigate the
                                            risk of supply disruption.
                                            Integrating a complete visibility solution into their supply chain is the
                                            answer.

                                            vital role for manufacturing business. The reason is that
                                            the core function of any manufacturing company is to produce the best
                                            quality products. And the
                                            second important factor for the business is to deliver the produced goods to
                                            the customer safely.
                                            Here the importance of distributors is visible. The distributors make and
                                            work on a strong route riding
                                            model through which they deliver goods from the manufacturer to their
                                            customers safely.
                                            The case critically defines the real-life scenario of Burque Corporation. It
                                            defines how the
                                            organization faces problems in their existing process that create trouble
                                            for the company. It also
                                            defines that if the problem when highlighted is not solved at the right
                                            moment it can create hurdles
                                            for the organization. The real-life scenarios as discussed in this case help

                                            gain practical knowledge from the findings. The case has tried to shed light
                                            upon the initiatives that
                                            were taken by the HR team to overcome the challenges. Also, the results of
                                            those steps were focused
                                            on identifying whether the initiatives that were taken were proved to be
                                            fruitful for the company or
                                            not. Further, the study also defines the period it took to overcome the
                                            challenges.

                                            having a traditional outlook, its values, and variety of food. Lal Qila is
                                            striving continuously to achieve

                                            The determination of conducting this project is to know about the current
                                            practices, procedures, and
                                            process flow of Lal Qila restaurant to analyze them in the context of

                                            human capital, structural capital, and relational capital, and to identify

                                            This project is based on experiential learning. In this, I have worked in
                                            Lal Qila restaurant with all its
                                            departments to know their processes and procedures and to get the actual
                                            insight of it. The reason
                                            for selecting a method of experiential learning is to get deep insight,
                                            understand and observe the
                                            actual processes and its challenges in the daily operations of the
                                            restaurant to get, examine and
                                            analyze the collected information for better and effective results.<br>
                                            The findings of this project reveal that the Lal Qila restaurant is trying
                                            its level best to achieve
                                            excellence and now it is in a developing stage, and it is trying to adopt
                                            best practices to improve the
                                            overall performance of the organization. It is also found that Lal Qila is
                                            using its ambiance of
                                            traditional look as a competitive advantage in the market.

                                            whether the replacement of Old Dornier Plain Air Jet Looms
                                            with New Picanol Air Jet Looms is financially feasible or not. Orient
                                            Textile Mills Ltd wants to increase
                                            its weaving production capacity. In fact, the existing production capacity
                                            of weaving looms is still
                                            limited and not comparable with increasing demand from the market.
                                            Therefore, to meet the current
                                            and expected future export orders management of the company intends to
                                            replace old Dornier Air
                                            Jet Looms with Picanol Air Jet Looms. This will help in increase in
                                            production capacity, production
                                            efficiency and as well as its profitability. <br>
                                            In order to draw a conclusion, this research was conducted to carry out
                                            investment analysis of new
                                            machines. Capital appraisal techniques used which include Accounting Rate of
                                            Return, Payback
                                            period, NPV, IRR and Profitability Index. The results show that Total
                                            Project Accounting Rate of
                                            Return is 18.42%, Payback Period is 3.23 years, Total project NPV is Rs.
                                            1,168,241,825/-, Internal Rate
                                            of Return of the project is 27.70% and Profitability Index is 2.15
                                            times.<br>
                                            However, this feasibility study has a few limitations. First, it does not
                                            consider other than Picanol
                                            Looms which may include Toyota Looms, Tsudakoma Looms, etc. Second, it does
                                            not consider new
                                            infrastructure cost because in my feasibility study we are working on
                                            replacement of old looms with
                                            new looms on existing infrastructure. However, these limitations may
                                            represent an important basis
                                            for future research.<br>

                                            This study contributes, in various ways, to enriching existing literature.
                                            In addition to analyze the
                                            project financially by using Decision making techniques, this study broadens
                                            the scope of application
                                            of Investment Appraisement in the textile industry of Pakistan, currently
                                            underused to interpret the
                                            phenomena in relation to capital investment decision techniques.<br>
                                            After a detailed analysis, I recommend to the management of Orient Textile
                                            Mills Ltd to replace Old
                                            Dornier Looms with New Picanol Looms as per plan because it is financially
                                            viable and it will
                                            strengthen the company's competitive position in the current competitive
                                            environment by
                                            enhancing its production capacity and profitability.

                                            The Supply chain is now known as a critical area of any organization’s
                                            success. This plays a key role
                                            in organization’s strategic planning. This involves tasks such as planning,
                                            procurement, warehousing,
                                            logistics, and quality control. If in any organization this task performs
                                            efficiently and effectively it will
                                            minimize process time, cost, reduce delay in processes, and provide
                                            acceptable services to their
                                            customers. Warehouse management is the key component of the supply chain.
                                            The purpose of
                                            warehousing is to store raw material and finished goods. It would be more
                                            costly for the organization
                                            if the goods are not stored with efficient planning. The aim of this project
                                            is to measure the
                                            performance of the company. Our target was to find a company with a
                                            warehouse, analyze their
                                            warehouse issues and also suggest solutions to those problems. We have
                                            decided to choose Union
                                            Fabrics warehouse for this project. Union is a denim textile and garment
                                            industry and one of the
                                            leading denim exporters of Pakistan. I have visited their warehouse Mr
                                            Shahzaib Shafi (Warehouse
                                            manager) briefed about the warehouse. I interviewed and also observed their
                                            working procedure
                                            that they use. To find out the issues I observed the warehouse in detail.
                                            There are different problems
                                            that I identify which include an un-efficient and lack of racking system,
                                            lack of technologies, lack of
                                            capacity and lack of safety in the warehouse. After identifying these
                                            problems I study, gather
                                            information and try to give them the best possible solutions for these
                                            problems. All the best possible
                                            solutions are provided on the basis of standard follows in warehousing, our
                                            studies regarding
                                            warehouse and market working process. The whole collection of data and
                                            suggested approaches are
                                            based on findings and our group discussions. The main goal of this project
                                            is to raise business
                                            awareness regarding appropriate warehousing, its importance, and its impact
                                            on company
                                            performance. Also, to examine problems and make appropriate recommendations
                                            in order to
                                            function successfully and efficiently.

                                            In the banking business, justice with workers is also a vital aspect that
                                            enhances employee happiness
                                            and performance. Inequality decisions hinder employee productivity and have
                                            both good and bad
                                            effects on the workplace and organization. Thus, one of the major issues
                                            most businesses and sectors
                                            confront is ensuring equal treatment for all workers. While high levels of
                                            trust ensure managers and
                                            staff execute their duties, it also enables employees to freely exchange
                                            ideas and information. As a
                                            result, they may be more open to sharing their thoughts and working together
                                            to achieve
                                            organizational objectives and goals. Especially for individuals who operate
                                            in an atmosphere of trust
                                            and honesty more at ease while expressing their emotions, communicating,
                                            ideas or opinions. Thus,
                                            communication is vital in the banking industry for staff to communicate with
                                            supervisors.
                                            Methods:The researcher will use both primary and secondary data sources to
                                            analyze the issue.
                                            Interviews will be the major source of data collection for the researcher
                                            (Lin et al., 2018).
                                            Alternatively, workplace mindfulness may be used to gather secondary data on
                                            the influence of
                                            job engagement and organizational justice on employee well-being. Use
                                            legitimate websites,
                                            research articles and journals by Emerald, academia, or Google Scholar.

                                            The restaurant industry is an important socioeconomic sector that makes a
                                            significant contribution
                                            to the economy. This study evaluates the impact of COVID-19 on the
                                            restaurant business that how
                                            the restaurant business affected due to lockdown by the government, lack of
                                            imported products due
                                            to complete ban on import by the government and the hyperinflation created
                                            by the traders also
                                            effected the restaurant badly. According to the study, as governments
                                            throughout the world
                                            implemented social distancing programs, movement restrictions, and lockdowns
                                            resulting in the loss
                                            of millions of jobs and billions of dollars in potential revenue. This
                                            research shows that how the
                                            restaurant industry suffered in Pakistan at the time of pandemic and how
                                            they recover after the end
                                            of this horrible period. In this research interview were conducted with
                                            multiple restaurant
                                            stockholders like owners or supply chain managers. Some restaurant named as
                                            under Lalqila, Café
                                            the rocks and pancakes, Chatterbox café and Chai Deewari. At the end of this
                                            research, we conclude
                                            that how the restaurants were effect and what are the major reasons for
                                            their loss at this bad time.
                                            After this research, we suggest some recommendations that what are the
                                            precautionary majors the
                                            restaurant industry can manage by which they can prevent that much loss for
                                            the industry if the
                                            pandemic like this hit back again ever. We also recommend government that
                                            how they take
                                            precautionary majors in the future to take some safety majors for the
                                            restaurant industry. Our
                                            research also supports the society to conduct the research on the different
                                            industries of Pakistan, as
                                            this research is only base on the restaurant of Pakistan.

                                            project report is M/s. Xpert Services (Private) Limited. This
                                            is a Private Limited company that has been incorporated with the Securities
                                            and Exchange
                                            Commission of Pakistan under section 32 of the Companies Ordinance 1984 on
                                            the 23rd of February
                                            2005. The company’s office is in Karachi. The principal line of their
                                            business is that they provide
                                            trained, skilled, and unskilled persons. The reason I have chosen this
                                            company is that it was accessible
                                            to me. The main purpose of this research was to study the company and
                                            identify the problems being
                                            faced by them. For this purpose, a detailed interview was conducted through
                                            which the problems
                                            came to light. The problems identified are selection of the right fit, long
                                            duration/ period to hire,
                                            applicants who are receiving other offers from other firms and facing a
                                            scam. After identifying the
                                            problems this case study also helps in how these issues/ problems could be
                                            solved by the
                                            recommendations given in the report. The recommendations that I have given
                                            are that the company
                                            should switch their use of traditional methods to modern methods, while
                                            reviewing the list of
                                            applicants they should remove the idea of perfect or ideal candidates and
                                            instead look for someone
                                            who would turn into prominent employees, third they should also target
                                            passive candidates, fourth
                                            they should streamline their process and start pre- planning. Also a proper
                                            research should be done
                                            on the candidate to avoid facing a scam. The above discussed recommendations
                                            would help them
                                            overcome the issues faced by them. Also this case study project research has
                                            also some limitations
                                            too. Therefore, the identified gaps will allow us to fill those gaps by
                                            exploring the phenomenon from
                                            other perspectives.

                                            The purpose for this Research is to obtain observant of the inefficiency in

                                            know that the payroll procedure is an imperative process for any
                                            organization; this includes a few
                                            actions to ensure that employees payments for their services are accurate
                                            and timely, and to protect
                                            the organization reputation by effectively complying with government labor
                                            standards. Apart from
                                            its important role in the planning process, payroll processing research is
                                            rather limited compared to
                                            other transaction processing systems such as sales and purchases, etc. This
                                            project aims to develop

                                            2018. This study aims to use bibliometric analysis to provide information on
                                            the characteristics of
                                            wage problems in Covid-19. Apprenticeships that matched with the keywords

                                            research papers has been obtained and investigated. Once the cleanup process
                                            is complete, it
                                            involves inserting survey metadata and deleting some scan and other simple
                                            options. Paid

                                            Now when I started doing
                                            research on this topic, first I gathered all the issues I personally
                                            experienced in the payroll
                                            department during that pandemic as if I’m working in payroll department
                                            since 2017. With the help

                                            of my personal experience I found out some critical issues that was creating
                                            major glitches and
                                            hurdles in payroll management System. Issues like; Employees Leaves

                                            have almost been resolved. The output of this project can help researchers
                                            to understand the
                                            landscape of the global research on disputes and hurdles on payroll
                                            management systems due to

                                            The main purpose of this project is to understand the dynamics of the
                                            performance management
                                            system in the company I have chosen, namely Butlers Bench which is a startup
                                            organization. The
                                            primary goal of this report is to identify the challenges and issues that a
                                            startup service company
                                            faces in implementation of a performance management system and how it can be
                                            overcome. To
                                            fulfill this purpose, I chose this service company which is a startup that
                                            means it’s in business not for
                                            long and the purpose was to identify the issues regarding the employee’s
                                            performance and its
                                            measurement in the startups. During the process of gathering relevant
                                            information, I came to know
                                            that there is absence of a structured performance management system, and it
                                            is limited to
                                            performance review and appraisals without any defined metrics for it. I also
                                            came to know that there
                                            is a communication gap between the management and the staff due to which the
                                            performance of
                                            the employees is getting effective and resulting in negative opinions
                                            sometimes. This study helped
                                            us in recognizing the issues and the root because of it and therefore I was
                                            able to recommend some
                                            solutions for them according to my understanding and limited knowledge. I
                                            hope that this study
                                            serves the purpose of the report and contributes positively to society in
                                            the service sector,
                                            particularly startup.

                                            resolving problems before they become serious in future. In this way looked
                                            at several marketing
                                            methods separately in order to determine the optimal combinations of
                                            effective marketing tactics.
                                            Major competitors such as BBQ Tonight and Areena have captured the biggest
                                            target market,
                                            although the following study has determined that LalQila must adopt several
                                            effective strategies that
                                            they have been currently not concentrating on, such as market penetration,

                                            and, market development, to reclaim its market share and acquire his
                                            targeted audience. In this way
                                            identify several problems like, overprice is charged, Worst customer
                                            services, Generic selling point,

                                            their services, and when
                                            they do, they choose marketing tactics that appear to be beneficial to them.
                                            People seek high quality
                                            meals at reasonable prices, using different pricing strategies followed by

                                            customers to the Lal Qila. Restaurant operators are always looking for ways
                                            to streamline operations
                                            and boost productivity. There are several elements to consider when looking

                                            level of the organization.
                                            For this purpose, I chose Master Molty foam – mattress segment for my
                                            business project. As the
                                            Master Molty Foam is a big organization and I am also working over there,
                                            therefore I chose this
                                            organization. During the interview I conducted it came to my knowledge that
                                            some of the major
                                            challenges the HR have to face is retention of existing employees and new
                                            employees, technological
                                            skill gap, low motivation in employees – skilled labor due to low intrinsic
                                            and extrinsic factors and
                                            the cost involved in talent acquisition. I also got to know that some of
                                            these challenges are tied
                                            directly or indirectly with the finances or budget limitation of the
                                            organization which held utmost
                                            importance in any organization. This study further helps in how these
                                            challenges can be solved by
                                            considering the employees as human capital- an asset to the organization. I
                                            have recommended
                                            some suggestions in this report according to my analysis and understanding
                                            of the problems to
                                            minimize the talent management issues. This can be done by introducing
                                            reward systems and
                                            employee recognition programs, annual increments, training and development
                                            programs and by
                                            giving incentives and other facilities to skilled laborers. This way it will
                                            not only help in retaining
                                            employees but also lower the risk of employees going to their competitor
                                            organization. Further it
                                            will also enhance the skills and abilities of the employees to be utilized
                                            for the progress of the
                                            organization.

                                            with Zoomlion Pakistan, the company financial manager, was conducted for the
                                            primary data. The
                                            goal of this study is to recommend an internal audit evaluation system for
                                            the organization in
                                            question. There were all aspects that should be included in this Audit
                                            Evaluation System.

                                            discovered. The report, on the other hand, includes a few flaws. First,
                                            information on the
                                            manufacturing sector and heavy equipment industry was tough to come by. The
                                            second problem we
                                            experienced was acquiring the Zoomlion
                                            Pakistan and Company some relevant documents, as the companies were hesitant
                                            to share their
                                            information due to confidentiality concerns. Finally, there is just the
                                            layout of a financial expert, which we did not have the opportunity to
                                            construct due to a lack of time and financial skills.
                                            Companies will be educated about the benefits of risk reduction and how to
                                            use it with the help of
                                            this study. Furthermore, they will be educated on how this knowledge would
                                            improve the financial
                                            reporting system, allowing Pakistani businesses to operate in a paperless
                                            atmosphere.
                                            They will be able to obtain financial skill-based employment in this manner.
                                            To recommendation of
                                            the company which factor create issue and used the financial tool and
                                            resolved problem other one
                                            is factor of exchange rate which change forward contract to minimize risk.
                                            The cause for the
                                            modification is due to a change in government policy that affects the
                                            corporate excise duty and tax
                                            rate. Because public policies have such a profound impact on businesses, it
                                            is in their best interests
                                            to keep informed about them and to try to influence government
                                            decision-making and public policy.
                                            It could be a difficult task. Due to limited time and resources to complete
                                            the study.

                                            that made Khaadi an exception from the other retail stores. Recommendations
                                            are made as to how
                                            the ecommerce strategies may enhance Khaadi’s digital approach and build

                                            Humans require shelter as one of their most basic needs. Slums and informal
                                            housing have sprung
                                            up because of Pakistan's fast urbanization. Pakistan's government has
                                            announced the
                                            commencement of the NAYA PAKISTAN HOUSING PROGRAM (NPHP), which aims to
                                            build 5 million
                                            housing units for low-income Pakistanis by 2023. This study looked at a lot
                                            of literature on affordable
                                            housing policies and methods across the world to find the best models for
                                            providing inexpensive
                                            housing. Ten professional bankers were interviewed. The cost and amount of
                                            land required to build
                                            5 million dwelling units were calculated. In addition, based on expert
                                            opinion in the country, this
                                            report examines a few tactics and policies that Naya Pakistan Housing
                                            Project might use to deliver 5
                                            million low-income housing units. It is proposed that the site and service
                                            model for this project be
                                            practical, and that the government provide substantial subsidies to real
                                            estate developers. This study
                                            also proposed the concept of social housing for Pakistan's low-income
                                            citizens. This study will be
                                            beneficial to policymakers, urban planners, and housing developers who will
                                            directly contribute to

                                            The word "e-banking" should be defined before we move any further in this

                                            banking has many different meanings depending on who you ask and where you
                                            get your
                                            information, and the term "e-banking" is no exception. This field is also
                                            home to a slew of jargon.
                                            These might refer to quite different things, the same thing, or even overlap

                                            the only one. Some banks
                                            began offering E-banking to consumers in 1985; however, the lack of internet
                                            users and the greater
                                            cost of electronic banking have stifled the expansion of online banking,
                                            according to Bob Batchelor.

                                            important input we need today. In Pakistan, textile industry is the very
                                            early adopter of renewable
                                            energy and has contributed to clean energy in the country. We have seen that
                                            many textile industries
                                            have set windmills and captive solar plants to run their mills efficiently.
                                            In Pakistan, solar systems
                                            are getting common nowadays. People are getting familiar with the advantages
                                            of solar panels, after
                                            watching the benefits of solar energy so many textile industries have
                                            decided to invest in solar
                                            systems in a big way. Textile industries are going towards solar energy
                                            because it is one of the
                                            cheapest sources of energy, they can get to run the industry. We can see
                                            that now many companies
                                            provide a solar system in the country and they give the warranty of their
                                            products. In Pakistan, the
                                            electricity tariff is quite high and it is very difficult for the company to
                                            run its operations on grid
                                            power. The price of solar energy minimizes their profit. Solar power tariff
                                            remains almost the same
                                            so that’s why it is also known as one of the cheapest forms of energy, in
                                            our country we can see that
                                            our conversational source tariff increases year on year.
                                            Due to the increase in rates of electricity and diesel Tata, the textile
                                            industry is trying to shift its
                                            operations to solar energy. Because of running the types of machinery on
                                            electricity and diesel
                                            company’s expense is increasing and due to shortage of electricity in the
                                            country, the company is
                                            facing a lot of problems like all the operations stop due to fluctuation and
                                            it's very dangerous for the
                                            types of machinery which cost millions of dollars. Tata Pakistan thought on
                                            this matter a lot like on
                                            what they should run the company, so they thought of running the operations
                                            on diesel but the cost
                                            of diesel is increasing day by day, and the cost of generators and their
                                            maintenance is also very much
                                            high, and the pollution caused from the diesel generators is also dangerous
                                            for the atmosphere.
                                            Due to these reasons, Tata Pakistan is trying to shift its energy use from
                                            electricity and diesel to solar
                                            power energy. Due to these reasons Tata Pakistan is trying to shift its
                                            energy use from electricity
                                            and diesel to solar power energy. Implementation of solar panels will help
                                            the Tata textile industry
                                            in saving a heavy amount monthly, which was spent on electricity bill and on
                                            diesel cost.
                                            Implementation of solar panels is the one time expense for the company but
                                            it will benefit the
                                            company in many ways.
                                            Tata textile Mill decided to change its performance from diesel generators
                                            and move from k-electric
                                            to solar power systems to increase its profitability and eliminate
                                            dependence on generators and k
                                            electricity. For example, most companies are trying to set up their own
                                            power stations. Some leading
                                            textile companies produce their own electricity to avoid these situations.
                                            The government should
                                            encourage larger units to generate energy and supply them with smaller
                                            units.

                                            Akram Textile Private Limited is a fastest growing textile industry which
                                            requires financing facility
                                            to purchase a property from Meezan Bank. They required financing to expand
                                            their business,
                                            production capacity and meet the customer demands on a timely basis. Energy
                                            crisis, surge in cash
                                            outflows, unusual expenses, and continuous fluctuation in the rate of dollar
                                            are also the other factors
                                            which makes Akram Textile to go for the financing from the Bank. We are
                                            three people who
                                            represent Akram Textile and try to get the financing to be done for them.
                                            Despite all the factors,
                                            Akram Textile has performed brilliantly in their short period of time in the
                                            Industry; Gul Ahmed,
                                            Yunus Textile and Deen Textile are their competitors as Akram Textile
                                            matches nearly all of them
                                            in a short period of time. They have one office in DHA which is on rent, so
                                            now they require another
                                            property in S.I.T.E Area in order to increase its production capacity. The
                                            management of Akram
                                            Textile wanted financing from any leading Islamic bank because they wanted
                                            to avoid typical
                                            conventional banking. Speaking about Meezan Bank, the most important element
                                            for them is to
                                            look at the company's credit history in which they were able to see whether
                                            they would be able to
                                            pay back the financing amount or not. They would look at all the factors
                                            which are included in the
                                            evaluation of credit risk to make sure that the company has no credit issues
                                            and no outstanding loan
                                            shown on their statement. Bank further checks e-CIB portals by looking at
                                            all the credit data of the
                                            company till date. Meezan Bank would be financing the property to Akram
                                            Textile under the
                                            contract of diminishing Musharakah, where both Bank and company made
                                            partnership in the
                                            property and after that, bank would ultimately sell its shares in the
                                            property to the company in the
                                            form of units.<br>
                                            Mr. Arshad Hussain, the sales & Marketing manager of Akram Textile founds
                                            few properties where
                                            all the relevant documents are completed and have proper leased from
                                            concerned authorities. After
                                            completion of all the background work, CEO of the company Mr. Muhammad Akram
                                            presented the
                                            proposal to Board of Directors Meeting for requiring its approval for
                                            availing financing from bank.
                                            The Board duly approved the resolution and advised the Management to select
                                            the suitable bank
                                            which would be able to give us a desired financing of property. Akram
                                            Textile started its
                                            methodology by Interviewing, Reading Sales manuals, evaluating Quotation
                                            Sheets, getting
                                            feedback from counterparts, and visiting websites of Meezan Bank, Dubai
                                            Islamic Bank, Bank
                                            Islami, HBL Islamic and MCB Islamic. We rejected the MCB Islamic and HBL
                                            Islamic straight
                                            after they forced us to avail conventional Style of financing. With careful
                                            consideration and
                                            evaluation, we have decided to choose Meezan bank as our financer, the
                                            reason for choosing them
                                            is purely because of positive attitude of their sales manager Mr. Arif
                                            Shabbir and providing
                                            reasonably good rates to us. He also assured that Meezan Bank would also
                                            help to find us a property
                                            which they will find soon in S.I.T.E area around 250 Sq yards.<br>
                                            This disbursement of financing would surely help Akram Textile to expand
                                            their business and also
                                            would be helpful to manage the cash outflows in a better way.

                                            combination of the English
                                            and Italian word Art & Regalo (Regalo is an Italian word which means gift or
                                            present). Artregalo

                                            more completely by
                                            hand. The demand for handmade products is rising day by day because it is
                                            environmentally friendly,
                                            attractive, unique, better quality and better designs. All these are the
                                            reasons that people are looking
                                            more towards handicrafts.In this report we share our personal experiences
                                            throughout the start of
                                            business and we also collect data from different publications, internet
                                            sources and student papers. In
                                            writing this report we have some limitations like privacy and hesitancy. We
                                            also have limitations
                                            like the lackness of resources, adequate capital investment, less knowledge
                                            of Social media
                                            platforms for marketing and creating prominent brand awareness. As discussed
                                            Artregalo is an
                                            online business and nowadays online business is capturing the market.
                                            Artregalo uses different
                                            online platforms to run business which includes official E-commerce website,
                                            Facebook page,
                                            Instagram page and Youtube Channel. The reason to run an online business is
                                            to provide a vast range
                                            of products easily accessible for the consumers to purchase on our social
                                            media platforms through
                                            the internet. The other benefit of online business is that it saves
                                            customers time. In this report we
                                            identified that the biggest problem of Artregalo is we are lacking a strong
                                            brand awareness strategy.
                                            To overcome this problem we worked on customers (who are they), Quality of
                                            product, retail brand,
                                            logo (for prominent brand identity). Behind the success of any business you
                                            must know each and
                                            everything about the market, especially about your competitors and we also
                                            must know about our
                                            strengths and weaknesses so we have done complete SWOT/ PEST analysis,
                                            problems, future
                                            problems and their likely solutions, opportunities for our business and
                                            brand.

                                            trading platform, "Rain," was scheduled to start, with all of the necessary
                                            formalities in place. Rain
                                            claims to be the first cryptocurrency exchange in the Middle East to receive
                                            a governmental license,
                                            as well as a member of an "exclusive group of exchanges globally."
                                            Pakistanis were able to buy and
                                            trade cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and others in a
                                            "safe and easy" manner
                                            through the Bahrain-based company. The company claimed to have created the
                                            platform on a
                                            "robust, scalable, and resilient" infrastructure that includes safeguards,
                                            services, and capabilities to
                                            make bitcoin investing simple and secure for Pakistanis.<br>
                                            "Rain's launch in Pakistan came at a critical moment in the market's
                                            evolution, when people urgently
                                            require a licensed and regulated cryptocurrency trading platform." The goal
                                            was to make
                                            cryptocurrency trading in the country incredibly secure, simple, and
                                            cost-effective for all present
                                            and potential crypto-traders." If Rain had to launch in Pakistan, it could
                                            have had the monopoly as
                                            there is not any registered Cryptocurrency platform available here like
                                            Binance, Coinbase, Kraken
                                            and BilBox in the world. Rain has already listed many cryptocurrencies, and
                                            the number is growing
                                            every day which could attract Pakistanis. It also provides crypto asset
                                            custodian services. Rain users
                                            would have to fill out a "know-your-customer" application form before being
                                            able to transact. When
                                            People will be having business with Rain, A lot of transactions can be run
                                            of crypto currency at a
                                            time but due to its scalability there is no guarantee of smoothness of
                                            transaction. If Rain had run its
                                            business in Pakistan, it could have been beneficial for Pakistan. But there
                                            are some limitations of
                                            Rain to start its business in Pakistan. As this was banned by the Government
                                            of Pakistan. The
                                            Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan is the final authority in the
                                            country for giving
                                            licenses to exchange companies. The Commission indeed granted a license to
                                            the said company to
                                            operate in the region. But it is wrongful to say that it is Pakistan’s
                                            first-ever company to have
                                            received a license. Nobody can run their own exchanges, according to the
                                            State Bank of Pakistan
                                            and SECP. Another reason which is a barrier on the way of Rain to start its
                                            business in Pakistan is
                                            the Halal or Haram of cryptocurrency. As most of the Ulamas are silent on
                                            this but there is a Fatwa
                                            from Malaysia about it that crypto is not Halal in any means.
