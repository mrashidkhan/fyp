                                            identify how the inventory is operating efficiently and
                                            effectively with the help of digitization. We have identified a problem in
                                            the inventory management of Dream Network and Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (DNTPL)
                                            where we have noticed
                                            that this
                                            organization (DNTPL) is not using a proper system for its whole inventory
                                            management. They have
                                            no idea how much stock they have in their stock right now.
                                            They only maintain a system for the inventory they have sold out but they
                                            also have an inventory
                                            deployed for projects. These projects may be for a longer period or shorter
                                            period. The actual
                                            discrepancy for inventory management is here. They have no system that can
                                            tell how much
                                            inventory is stuck in a project and how much is exactly available in the

                                            is
                                            characterized as one of the most influential sectors
                                            across the world. Employee retention refers to an organization's voluntary
                                            decision to build an
                                            environment that retains its core employees engaged for a longer period of
                                            time. Retention of
                                            employees has become one of the major challenges faced by the firms and
                                            because of this employee
                                            turnover increases. Employee turnover increases the risk of losing good
                                            staff. Therefore, to retain
                                            skilled employees is very important for the organizationâ€™s performance and
                                            success.<br>
                                            <b>PURPOSE:</b> The research was conducted to examine the factors that
                                            influence
                                            the employee
                                            retention and turnover in the pharmaceutical sectors, using GETZ Pharma as
                                            the context. It
                                            determines the issues and challenges from the employeesâ€™ perception and to
                                            explore whether the
                                            company has adequate retention policies to retain their employees. The
                                            findings will be valuable for
                                            companies striving to increase job satisfaction and are concerned to retain
                                            their employees. The
                                            study may help the policy makers find out the different approaches in
                                            dealing with retention issues
                                            and help the management with appropriate guidance for effective retention
                                            strategies. <br>
                                            <b>METHOD:</b> The outcome of this study is derived from the collection of
                                            primary
                                            information.
                                            Qualitative approach has been used to conduct in-depth interviews with the
                                            Territory Managers of
                                            GETZ Pharma. Structured research questions were developed based on the
                                            literature to investigate
                                            the major issue, and these related to career advancement, compensation,
                                            skill recognition, stress at
                                            workplace, training etc. open-ended questions were also encouraged to
                                            acquire the wider grasp of
                                            thoughts and employeesâ€™ experiences.
                                            FINDINGS: The results of this paper shows that employees of GETZ Pharma are
                                            dissatisfied with
                                            some of the factors that influence their decision to stay or leave in the
                                            organization. They emphasize
                                            on unusual working hours or work-life imbalance, less gross salaries. The
                                            company has implemented
                                            the retention strategies but somehow from the employeesâ€™ perception, the
                                            company lacks in
                                            providing these factors. It is important for the organization to make the
                                            employees feel satisfied
                                            which will ultimately increase their productivity and performance of the
                                            organization.

                                            possible so to run a textile mill electricity is the most
                                            important input we need today. In Pakistan, textile industry is the very
                                            early adopter of renewable
                                            energy and has contributed to clean energy in the country. We have seen that
                                            many textile industries
                                            have set windmills and captive solar plants to run their mills efficiently.
                                            In Pakistan, solar systems
                                            are getting common nowadays. People are getting familiar with the advantages
                                            of solar panels, after
                                            watching the benefits of solar energy so many textile industries have
                                            decided to invest in solar
                                            systems in a big way. Textile industries are going towards solar energy
                                            because it is one of the
                                            cheapest sources of energy, they can get to run the industry. We can see
                                            that now many companies
                                            provide a solar system in the country and they give the warranty of their
                                            products. In Pakistan, the
                                            electricity tariff is quite high and it is very difficult for the company to
                                            run its operations on grid
                                            power. The price of solar energy minimizes their profit. Solar power tariff
                                            remains almost the same
                                            so thatâ€™s why it is also known as one of the cheapest forms of energy, in
                                            our country we can see that
                                            our conversational source tariff increases year on year. <br>
                                            Due to the increase in rates of electricity and diesel Tata, the textile
                                            industry is trying to shift its
                                            operations to solar energy. Because of running the types of machinery on
                                            electricity and diesel
                                            companyâ€™s expense is increasing and due to shortage of electricity in the
                                            country, the company is
                                            facing a lot of problems like all the operations stop due to fluctuation and
                                            it's very dangerous for the
                                            types of machinery which cost millions of dollars. Tata Pakistan thought on
                                            this matter a lot like on
                                            what they should run the company, so they thought of running the operations
                                            on diesel but the cost
                                            of diesel is increasing day by day, and the cost of generators and their
                                            maintenance is also very much
                                            high, and the pollution caused from the diesel generators is also dangerous
                                            for the atmosphere.
                                            Due to these reasons, Tata Pakistan is trying to shift its energy use from
                                            electricity and diesel to solar
                                            power energy. Due to these reasons Tata Pakistan is trying to shift its
                                            energy use from electricity
                                            and diesel to solar power energy. Implementation of solar panels will help
                                            the Tata textile industry
                                            in saving a heavy amount monthly, which was spent on electricity bill and on
                                            diesel cost.
                                            Implementation of solar panels is the one time expense for the company but
                                            it will benefit the
                                            company in many ways. <br>
                                            Tata textile Mill decided to change its performance from diesel generators
                                            and move from k-electric
                                            to solar power systems to increase its profitability and eliminate
                                            dependence on generators and k
                                            electricity. For example, most companies are trying to set up their own
                                            power stations. Some leading
                                            textile companies produce their own electricity to avoid these situations.
                                            The government should
                                            encourage larger units to generate energy and supply them with smaller
                                            units.

                                            look at the company's credit history in which they were able to see whether
                                            they would be able to
                                            pay back the financing amount or not. They would look at all the factors
                                            which are included in the
                                            evaluation of credit risk to make sure that the company has no credit issues
                                            and no outstanding loan
                                            shown on their statement. Bank further checks e-CIB portals by looking at
                                            all the credit data of the
                                            company till date. Meezan Bank would be financing the property to Akram
                                            Textile under the
                                            contract of diminishing Musharakah, where both Bank and company made
                                            partnership in the
                                            property and after that, bank would ultimately sell its shares in the
                                            property to the company in the
                                            form of units.<br>
                                            Mr. Arshad Hussain, the sales & Marketing manager of Akram Textile founds
                                            few properties where
                                            all the relevant documents are completed and have proper leased from
                                            concerned authorities. After
                                            completion of all the background work, CEO of the company Mr. Muhammad Akram
                                            presented the
                                            proposal to Board of Directors Meeting for requiring its approval for
                                            availing financing from bank.
                                            The Board duly approved the resolution and advised the Management to select
                                            the suitable bank
                                            which would be able to give us a desired financing of property. Akram
                                            Textile started its
                                            methodology by Interviewing, Reading Sales manuals, evaluating Quotation
                                            Sheets, getting
                                            feedback from counterparts, and visiting websites of Meezan Bank, Dubai
                                            Islamic Bank, Bank
                                            Islami, HBL Islamic and MCB Islamic. We rejected the MCB Islamic and HBL
                                            Islamic straight
                                            after they forced us to avail conventional Style of financing. With careful
                                            consideration and
                                            evaluation, we have decided to choose Meezan bank as our financer, the
                                            reason for choosing them
                                            is purely because of positive attitude of their sales manager Mr. Arif
                                            Shabbir and providing
                                            reasonably good rates to us. He also assured that Meezan Bank would also
                                            help to find us a property
                                            which they will find soon in S.I.T.E area around 250 Sq yards.<br>
                                            This disbursement of financing would surely help Akram Textile to expand
                                            their business and also
                                            would be helpful to manage the cash outflows in a better way.

                                            people. Food supply chain system highly depends on extensive transpiration
                                            and high energy
                                            consuming procedures and requirement of making agricultural products

                                            on the rise and governments all around the world are devising new

                                            changes to other policies so that all activities related to urban
                                            agriculture are recognized, managed
                                            and promoted. Urban farming is not something entirely new, rather itâ€™s been
                                            around from centuries
                                            and in fact just like the cities themselves urban agriculture techniques are
                                            ancient as well. Number
                                            of benefits that can be achieved by utilizing households for food
                                            production. These benefits range
                                            from improved nutritional status of urban residents and their general health
                                            to improved savings and
                                            income. That is the reason that these activities can potentially lead to the
                                            development of assistance
                                            organizations and authorities that will include urban agriculture activities
                                            into the list of more
                                            sustainable and cost effective strategies.
