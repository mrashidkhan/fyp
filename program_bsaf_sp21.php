                                            In the modern world businesses are adopting technology in a way that can
                                            increase the efficiency of
                                            the business. In businesses making the right decision at the right time is
                                            very important to make
                                            goals for the good productivity of the business and this is only possible if
                                            the data is well organized.
                                            We selected a small business of Auto Spare parts named “Auto Craft”. The
                                            business is engaged in
                                            manufacturing, retailing, and providing services to its customers. The
                                            business specialized in four
                                            types of products that is clutch plates, pressure plate, brake pads and
                                            brake shoe. The business had
                                            a good capacity to grow but due to manual accounting system the business is
                                            prone to many issues
                                            that is loss of sales due to inadequate inventory management, conflict with
                                            vendors due to mis
                                            allocation of records, unable to track their expenses, recognizing the
                                            position of business at the end
                                            of month and other related issues. We suggested them automate their
                                            accounting system, which was
                                            quite convincing because small businesses are reluctant to make heavy
                                            investment and due to their
                                            less knowledge about the technology. Keeping in view of the requirements of
                                            the business we list
                                            different software and find Bookkeeper software as a best possible solution
                                            to the problems of Auto
                                            Craft as the modules of this software suited best for the business. The
                                            automation made the data
                                            efficient, the statistics of data were automated further the inventory,
                                            invoicing, vendors system,
                                            expenses were also automated. Automation also promoted the green environment
                                            by reducing the
                                            use of paper. The results show that the automation was beneficial for the
                                            business as the bad debts
                                            percentage on average decreased by 0.81% and 4% sales increased due to
                                            inventory management.
                                            The automation brings the accounting of the Auto Craft on a single dashboard
                                            where the owner can
                                            see the position of business daily.

                                            a small business can best use a computerized accounting system
                                            in order to avoid any risks and stay organized. The research found that
                                            computers have the power to help
                                            businesses adapt quickly to changing conditions, meet organizational goals,
                                            and manage their finances
                                            effectively. Additionally, many problems were identified during the
                                            assessment of the company’s accounting
                                            and inventory system such as their accounting system was very weak and their
                                            inventory management system
                                            is also weak. The basic aim of this research is to analyze the proper
                                            control and maintain the inventory system
                                            and to provide the effective training relatively for managing the updated
                                            accounting system, inventory
                                            control, and other related records. To achieve our goal, we have implemented
                                            accounting and inventory
                                            policies and procedures. The key principles of the accounting system are to
                                            achieve accuracy in their
                                            accounting system, relevancy, reliability, consistency, budgetary control
                                            and to control the expenditures
                                            properly. The key principles for inventory management system are to
                                            establish an inventory control system,
                                            to set reorder points, to implement stock counting, to track inventory
                                            turnover, to monitor supplier
                                            performance, to implement Just-in time inventory, to monitor inventory
                                            levels and to invest in inventory
                                            management software. The sale and purchase system must also be in a proper
                                            sequence to avoid any kind of
                                            problem. The study suggested that how a proper implemented system can avoid
                                            accounting and inventory
                                            problems that can be created in a small business. The implementation can
                                            also reduce the man force required
                                            to maintain accounting and inventory. The end result can lead us to that how
                                            we can monitor and enhance the
                                            business performance with the implementation of accounting software.
