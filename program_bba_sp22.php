                                            The plan of this project is to find out the Problems in Meji’s supply chain
                                            processes. The processes
                                            run from Meji are very old. We need to check the reason and find out the
                                            best possible solution to
                                            run all the processes of Meji’s supply chain effectively and efficiently.
                                            Meji was a bakery since 1992
                                            and Mehran Food industries introduced Meji brand in 2010. Meji is a FMCG
                                            industry that makes
                                            Bread, Fruit Bun, Burger Bun, Rusks and Tea Cakes daily and sends them to
                                            retail shops because
                                            it's a perishable item with 2 days life which is mentioned on the packet.
                                            Moving from bakery to
                                            FMCG firm, Meji has to compete in a market where many other brands are
                                            available and have to
                                            build up a strong image towards customers and to do this Meji has to adopt
                                            advanced operations and
                                            processes. We have conducted few surveys and met higher officials in Meji
                                            and see the whole supply
                                            chain process and to enhance the processes of Meji supply chain we apply all
                                            the knowledge we
                                            gain from our studies read few articles and research paper and also we took
                                            help from our project
                                            supervisor and other teachers who are relevant to the field to find out the
                                            best possible solutions to
                                            improve the whole supply chain process of Meji. Currently the manual system
                                            is old and should be
                                            replaced by new technology for advanced operations for gaining huge market
                                            size. The problems in
                                            the Meji process we identified are E-Procurement, No Quality Assurance
                                            Department, Decentralized
                                            database, No Proper Automation and Price instability. All the processes are
                                            manual run. Meji
                                            Production is 50% automated and 50% manual. Meji has to adopt some positive
                                            changes for
                                            efficient forecasts and effective production. All these changes will help
                                            Meji productivity and better
                                            outcomes. All the Supply Chain processes of Meji will be controlled and
                                            managed easily and their
                                            production manager can make good decision making. Current processes of Meji
                                            are too old and
                                            disturbing the Meji Supply chain. We have also find out what will be the
                                            cost and what will be the
                                            benefits to adopt each change which will help the Meji Management to analyze
                                            and make a good
                                            decision and adopt the solution to compete in the market and gain the market
                                            share and increase the
                                            profit margin.

                                            with your big idea, big idea do more than just to sell your product it’s
                                            more of a concept that you fit
                                            into your audience mind, the demand idea when the concept is already being
                                            exist and there is an
                                            opportunity of it to launch in the different market situation or it has been
                                            demanded <br>
                                            This idea is a great opportunity because large populations of Pakistan are
                                            fond to dine-out and
                                            usually bills are shared among them. Trends in Pakistan are changing day by
                                            day people are more
                                            into outdoor dine-in than eating at home and they are also becoming more
                                            socialized.<br>
                                            Food industry market in Pakistan is rapidly growing and expanding, these
                                            restaurants are willing to
                                            provide high end services to their customers for retention and by launching
                                            this service this will be
                                            a plus point for the restaurants to gather more customers by simply using
                                            this application in their
                                            restaurant. While a lot of people, especially young, like to visit
                                            restaurants, this is mostly thought
                                            more of a social gathering than experiencing the good food. E-commerce led
                                            the start-up culture in
                                            urban areas of Pakistan, which is due to higher demand for cell phones and
                                            iPad from young age
                                            groups. The new start-ups have provided a base to connect the domestic
                                            market with the international
                                            markets.<br>
                                            This will surely be a successful venture because no one has developed this
                                            till now and our target
                                            market is eagerly waiting for this type of concept.

                                            Baluchistan Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (BPPRA) was formed in
                                            2014 to ensure the
                                            transparency of the buying processes and tender allotments in the province,
                                            In the 2017-18 financial
                                            year, BPPRA took several initiatives to introduce sound procurement
                                            practices that cause higher
                                            procurement within the province. And as BPPRA is trying implement
                                            e-procurement system for the
                                            development and better transparency, we decided to take part in this for our
                                            project in order to help
                                            BPPRA by identifying the problems and search for different alternate
                                            solution for every problem. In
                                            order to identify the problem first thing, we did is Studying the Acts and
                                            Rules which company is
                                            based upon because it is a government company. After that we take interviews
                                            from different
                                            personalities of the company in order to understand the current operations
                                            which Includes these steps
                                            (Submission of bids, provision of bidding document content of bidding
                                            document, reservation and
                                            preference, bid security, goods warranty, bid validity, extension of time
                                            period for submission bid,
                                            clarification and modification of bidding documents.). After understanding
                                            the current operations,
                                            we identified four major problems faced by BPPRA after implementing the
                                            e-procurement system
                                            which are (delay in bidding due to approval from higher authorities and

                                            customers training and development e-procurement maintenance cost). Then we
                                            find different
                                            solutions for the problem (Automation of Processes, Notifications sent
                                            automatically, Ad-Hoc

                                            Pakistan is very famous for its clothing trends this is the reason it is
                                            competing well and today in
                                            21st century there are many clothing brands in Pakistan each of them
                                            competing well. Some of the
                                            Pakistani clothing brands are the following like Nishat linen, Khaadi,
                                            Sapphire, Gul Ahmed and
                                            Alkaram.<br>
                                            So we have basically worked on Alkaram Studio ,Alkaram studio also have its
                                            textile mills and it is
                                            a part of textile industry so it shows its contributing in Pakistan’s
                                            textile industry.<br>
                                            Under Alkaram we have worked on its sub category known as “MAK” –Miss
                                            Alkaram which has a
                                            very weak advertising strategy and brand awareness further more we have also
                                            worked on its
                                            opportunity which is to expand its males segment. According to our results
                                            it have shown that 97%
                                            of the people agree that “MAK” has a weak brand awareness strategies and
                                            Alkaram has small
                                            segment of males. For which we have proposed many real recommendations and
                                            their likely results
                                            in our project.

                                            Pakistan civil aviation is a public sector autonomous entity under the
                                            jurisdiction of Pakistan's
                                            federal government. The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) was created
                                            on December 7,
                                            1982, by an order. This authority is responsible for controlling aviation
                                            activities and overseeing
                                            airline operations. Staffing is the people who work for a firm are its
                                            lifeblood in a very big way.
                                            Staffing, often known as recruitment and selection, kind of is the continual
                                            process of locating,
                                            selecting, evaluating, and training existing and future workers. The expense
                                            of paying staff
                                            compensation, for the most part, is by far the very much the largest issue
                                            linked with this, which is
                                            quite significant. When a company generally is overstaffed, there
                                            specifically is usually not enough
                                            work to generally go around for everyone, really contrary to popular belief.
                                            PCAA has over 10,000
                                            employees, indicating that it is a large corporation. But if staff is
                                            skillful it is beneficial for the
                                            organization but if staff is not skillful it will create some problems for
                                            the skillful employees which
                                            creates overstaffing. Overstaffing allows a company to resource unplanned
                                            activities, absorb the
                                            impacts of absence, and maximize unexpected opportunities when they arise.
                                            As a result, having too
                                            many employees may impair the organization's profitability. Overstaffing
                                            creates a lot of issues in
                                            PCAA of giving equal performance appraisal to all the employees whether they
                                            are working or not,
                                            the workload on lower management because of the higher officers who
                                            pressurize them to do their
                                            work and got all the praises and they are appointed by using their political
                                            references. This results
                                            as the disengaged and demotivation among the employees. PCAA is trying to
                                            eliminate the
                                            overstaffing because they came under the radar of the government. In PCAA
                                            almost every depart
                                            are came in overstaffed because there is not much work for the employees but
                                            they are enjoying
                                            higher salaries for not doing any work. Pakistan it is not easy to deal with
                                            such problems they have
                                            to be very careful dealing with these problems especially because this is a
                                            government organization,
                                            such things should be taken into consideration with such care. PCAA is
                                            working properly and paying
                                            attention to their employees properly as they are the asset of the
                                            organization.
