                                            The purpose of this feasibility study is to determine whether or not
                                            replacing 20 years old
                                            machines with new start of the art having 800 RPM machines financially
                                            feasible. OTML currently
                                            have 257 looms machine which includes 90 Dornier Plain Looms machine, 64

                                            Looms machine and 40 Dornier Jacquard Looms machine. These machines are 20
                                            years old and
                                            now it became outdated due its low RPM and high maintenance cost. Therefore
                                            OTML wants to
                                            increase the production capacity of its weaving mill by replacing old
                                            Dornier machines with new
                                            Picanol machines to cater the increasing demand and to provide good quality
                                            product to their
                                            customers. This project will help in increase in machines capacity,
                                            productivity and as well as its
                                            profitability.
                                            OTML would like to fund this project through the State Bank Long Term
                                            Financing Facility (LTFF).
                                            Export-oriented companies whose project involves at least 50 export-related

                                            This report examines the two main issues of Ufone PTML. The first issue was
                                            the declining
                                            revenues of the company as well as the decreasing amount of market share in
                                            terms of the
                                            subscriber base. Secondly during and after the COVID-19 implications, the
                                            overall telecom
                                            market has been in quite a deteriorating condition as the buying power of
                                            the people drops
                                            to a considerable level. The grave effect of COVID-19element on overall
                                            economy of Pakistan
                                            as well as the individual spending of the low and medium value customers
                                            played an
                                            important role in the decision of the company to launch a product like
                                            UPower scratch cards
                                            which can be of low cost and according to the specific requirements of the
                                            customers. During
                                            the COVID-19 period, it was observed that the buying power of the consumer
                                            is declining
                                            quite rapidly as the major chunk of the Ufone subscriber belongs to medium
                                            and low value
                                            customer category and many of the white-collar people who bought another
                                            Ufone product
                                            i.e., Ufone Super Card were also declining to buy it due to its high amount
                                            and unused buckets
                                            till the end of its validity. Now there is a requirement in the market for
                                            customized cards at
                                            affordable cost in which subscribers can select a package plan for
                                            themselves. In this project,
                                            according to the present analysis of customer’s usage from PTA reports, it
                                            is suggested to
                                            introduce more variants with further increase in validity along with the
                                            attractive customized
                                            packages that will help to attain more subscribers towards the Ufone network
                                            and people
                                            really feel that they are the owner of this product.

                                            The main objective of this hypothetical analysis defines the identification
                                            of the newly developed
                                            field of green supply chain initial induction to the traditional supply

                                            (PPA) and involvement of company’s equity. Our Aim is to study the newly
                                            developed market
                                            with the spread of green energy to sustain the environment and to move

                                            Nestle Pakistan has a good geographic presence with one of the most amazing
                                            geologically
                                            differentiated sources of income. In contrast, Nestle Pakistan is facing
                                            critique of excessive water
                                            consumption, the sale of spoiled food, trade unionism, restrictions on child

                                            methods of exploitation. The contaminated food by Nestle Pakistan is a big
                                            weakness. Nestle
                                            Pakistan is facing customer awareness problems of Maggi noodles in Pakistani
                                            market. Today,
                                            Pakistan is the largest market for Maggi noodles. The brand has become
                                            productive lately, so it
                                            took a long time to establish itself in the Pakistani market. Nestle
                                            Pakistan should avoid
                                            contaminated foods by Nestle Pakistan. This study aims to see how Nestle can
                                            obtain high brand
                                            awareness, Nestle Pakistan must have strengths. Trusted brands are paramount
                                            and have their
                                            own character and voice. Nestle Pakistan should boost the amount of content
                                            it provides with
                                            entertaining web scenes and make sure the content is excellent and resonates
                                            with customers.
                                            Referrals give existing customers the motivating power to recommend products
                                            or services to

                                            will be completed by
                                            Big Deal Network. The document highlights all the details for commencing the
                                            project and then
                                            notifying why it stopped in middle of the construction back in 2014. What
                                            causes were faced by
