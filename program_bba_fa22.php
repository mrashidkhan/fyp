                                            the online existence of their business. Furthermore, they only target
                                            face-to-face customers and did
                                            not pay attention to the online customer. The revenue depends on the number

                                            leave the loopholes which
                                            sometimes become the major problem and should bring it to failure. They
                                            should set their target
                                            market right and should focus on both online and physical business. This
                                            project will be helpful and

                                            The purpose of our project is to introduce a delicious dessert called
                                            Cust-Nuts. It's part of the
                                            confectionery industry that contains healthy ingredients that have a
                                            delightful taste. To launch the
                                            product, we have performed market research and developed a vision as well as
                                            a mission statement
                                            for our brand Sweet-mEAtS. As a company, our primary focus is on serving
                                            health-conscious, dietconscious, and taste-conscious individuals who do not
                                            compromise on quality. In addition, research
                                            has been undertaken into Sweet-mEAtS's potential customers so that it has
                                            been able to develop
                                            segments to better serve the market by better serving them. Our company has
                                            conducted internal and
                                            external analyses and studied market forces, shareholders, stakeholders, and
                                            potential customers to
                                            gain market insights. As a second measure, we have utilized digital
                                            platforms for advertising and
                                            promotional purposes to raise public awareness of our dessert. To determine
                                            how to serve customers
                                            more effectively, we have developed different business strategies along with
                                            an in-depth analysis of
                                            all product Ps and customer Cs. To conclude, the company has developed a
                                            “Business Model” that
                                            governs every aspect of the production process. It includes everything from
                                            the collection of raw
                                            materials to the delivery of products to the customer in a timely manner. We
                                            have incorporated the
                                            concepts and theories discussed in Philip Kotler's book Principles of
                                            Marketing into the business
                                            plan. In addition, we have incorporated suggestions made by different
                                            skilled professionals in the
                                            relevant field, in order to create a successful business plan. Solutions are

                                            importance based on our extensive
                                            study of the subject.

                                            The onset of the COVID-19 epidemic provided an opportunity to reconsider the
                                            working
                                            environment of staff members. The need to implement a quarantine along with
                                            other preventative
                                            measures was aimed at slowing down the spread of pandemic attack. This
                                            resulted in a pause in
                                            routine life in terms of reduced social gatherings and economic activities.
                                            Universities have a fair
                                            share of responsibility in adjusting to the new strategy of social
                                            distancing. A hybrid work model is
                                            a structured arrangement that divides an employee's time between in-office
                                            and remote work. The
                                            choice of whether to work from home or in the office is occasionally left up
                                            to the employee. There
                                            is no hybrid approach that fits every situation. Employee engagement,
                                            motivation, reduced
                                            communication, employee mental health issues, performance management, job
                                            satisfaction etc. are
                                            the challenges faced to the employers that affect the employee performance
                                            in the contemporary
                                            workplaces. The concept of Hybrid working is being adopted by organizations
                                            all over the world in
                                            an effort to manage performance, address issues and offer flexibility at the
                                            workplace. This project
                                            offers an understanding and mechanism on how a hybrid work model can be
                                            implemented in the
                                            universities of Pakistan. A hybrid work model proposed in this project will
                                            be greatly beneficial to
                                            the faculty members, staff and senior management of the universities in
                                            terms of cost savings,
                                            judicious use of resources and improved workplace flexibility.

                                            In this report we are analyzing the Monsalwa marketing strategies. We are

                                            sectors of Pakistan which are textile, manufacturing and Food and beverages
                                            industry. But we've
                                            select food industry, we target the frozen food industry of Pakistan to know
                                            if in Pakistan frozen
                                            foods are necessary or luxury. We did research on this industry and on the
                                            companies those are
                                            selling frozen items like K&Ns, Monsalwa, Sabrosso, Dawn etc. From these

                                            the oldest company which already made their name in market from past years
                                            to know about what
                                            problems currently they're facing with new trends. Monsalwa Company which
                                            was established in
                                            1997 by SANAULLAH groups of companies. We got to know that Monsalwa company
                                            sales ratio
                                            is very low in the market currently compared to other brands. Why? Because
                                            of low marketing
                                            strategies others companies like K&Ns and Sabrosso they capturing the market
                                            rapidly so far
                                            because they have strong marketing strategies they spending millions on
                                            their advertisings. They are
                                            using Above the line (ABL) marketing strategies like mass marketing, paid
                                            campaigns, billboard
                                            marketing, social media marketing etc. But Monsalwa does not have budget for
                                            their marketing
                                            campaigns. They are still using Below The line (BTL) marketing strategies
                                            that doesn’t required
                                            huge amount of money. We have suggested them some marketing strategies that
                                            will help them to
                                            uplift their sale. During the research in Monsalwa and after some surveys
                                            from different marts and
                                            super stores we got the information about that one product which is leading
                                            them facing the declining
                                            market share and that product is their parathas we surveyed the market and
                                            find a flow in this product
                                            that this product is not like the other brands quality parathas. The
                                            difference between other and
                                            Monsalwa brand parathas was that when a consumer tries to refrigerate the
                                            paratha after the two
                                            days it's get sticky and give sour taste on it. Not just that one super mart
                                            store employee said that
                                            consumer have to come and replace that specific product just to get the
                                            other brand product. The
                                            parathas not give much crispness it also breaks apart. We suggested them to
                                            work on that specific
                                            product firstly because when Monsalwa started their name in frozen food
                                            market. There parathas
                                            were the most popular product. But we've seen from the past years that when
                                            they started focusing
                                            on launching the more product the core products started to get in worst
                                            quality.

                                            <b>BACKGROUND:</b> Findings with the advent of SLICE JUICE, PepsiCo
                                            increases their
                                            beverage line of products, although this has been missing into the market by
                                            their product
                                            slice (apple). PepsiCo launched their product slice (mango) with a
                                            significant advertisement,
                                            but they did not focus on the advertisement or, to put it another way, the
                                            branding of the slice
                                            (apple), as a result of which the product has no brand image in the market.
                                            A quick, clear,
                                            and valuable message should be presented to develop an acceptable brand
                                            image in the eyes
                                            of clients.<br>
                                            <b>PURPOSE:</b> The goal of this study is to describe the components so that
                                            brand positioning
                                            can be attempted. Price tactics, product innovation, market location, and
                                            advertising will be
                                            the emphasis of this project in order for the product to continue to work.
                                            We will provide
                                            tactical answers to the issue of a distinct brand image by naming and
                                            positioning the product.
                                            As the product extends into other areas, the corporation will generate more
                                            income.<br>
                                            <b>METHOD:</b> The primary data will be collected using a qualitative
                                            methodology for
                                            measurable analysis of information assortment and interview questions. It
                                            collects, analyses,
                                            and explains data in order to determine the qualities. Some interview
                                            questions will be
                                            planned and prepared ahead of time, while others will be developed on the
                                            spot. <br>
                                            <b>FINDINGS:</b> Slice (Apple) was not pushed into the market as a
                                            consequence of the interview
                                            because it was an unexpected product that was launched into the market.
                                            Furthermore, the
                                            product's brand positioning will introduce a new flavor to the market and
                                            help the product
                                            sell quickly. They should not leave any loopholes in the product definition,
                                            as these can
                                            become huge problems and cause it to fail. They must correctly define their
                                            target market
                                            and concentrate on health-related issues.

                                            <b>Purpose:</b> <br>
                                            The purpose to start this business is to provide everyone the fresh and pure
                                            water. We focuses on
                                            the all classes who are not able to purchase Nestle or Aquafina, our water
                                            is as best as Nestle or

                                            <b>METHOD</b><br>
                                            It is a feasibility report which was based on the physical appearance of the
                                            product in the market.<br>
                                            <b>FINDINGS</b><br>
                                            As evident from all the above information, it is seen that RO plants are the
                                            most cost effective
                                            method of water treatment due to their massively high efficiency, moderate
                                            use of chemicals as
                                            compared to the deionization plants and a rather simplistic approach and
                                            considering Pakistan’s
                                            water shortage issue, this seems to be the best solution but it’s high
                                            initial capital cost due to its
                                            equipment may be a bit of an hindrance, but with sufficient investment from
                                            the private and
                                            government sectors, it can prove to be a massively successful project in the
                                            long run.

                                            Food delivery apps have gained exceptional growth in today’s world because
                                            the trend of online
                                            orders has gained an edge among people. Therefore, Foodpanda’s app has
                                            become a valuable app in
                                            the market of Pakistan. This is the only food delivery app in the country
                                            which is offering online
                                            ordering services to consumers in Pakistan. That is why it is equally
                                            important among the local
                                            consumers and food and drink suppliers in Pakistan.
                                            Therefore, this project started with the purpose to know about the impact of
                                            the Foodpanda app on
                                            the growth of the restaurant industry in Pakistan. Foodpanda should be
                                            brought some effective
                                            changes and improvisations in its app because the consumers and specially
                                            suppliers have expressed
                                            a few challenges.
